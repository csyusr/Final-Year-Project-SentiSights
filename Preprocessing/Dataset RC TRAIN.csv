A special thank you to the best hotel coordinator, Sarah Benjamin, who managed the Grand Ballroom flawlessly and ensured all family hotel rooms were perfectly arranged and well taken care of. Her professionalism, calmness, and attention to detail truly made everything seamless.

The food was absolutely excellent — huge appreciation to Chef Haniff and his sous chef for delivering delicious dishes that impressed all our guests. We received so many compliments, and everyone was genuinely happy and satisfied with the food.

Thank you Royal Chulan Damansara team for making our wedding memorable, smooth, and truly special. Highly recommended for anyone looking for top-notch wedding service and hospitality.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

The location is very strategic - easy access to main roads and highways. Also, just next to The Curve Mall which has many excellent restaurants and cafes. Ikea, KidZania and other interesting places are just walking distance.||We booked directly way in advance and we felt the room rates is very reasonable.||The rooms we stayed (4 rooms) are all decent although quite dated but still fully functional. ||My issues with this hotel are mostly related to its customer service. Firstly, we’re not sure whether this hotel has concierge services. It’s almost none existence when we were there. They are some people at the main entrance who wore security guard uniform. They did help us with our luggages when we first arrive but when we checked-out those guys with security uniform didn’t even bother to help with our luggages. Not sure whether they are security guards or the hotel concierge team.||The front desk team is efficient but not exactly the friendliest we have dealt with. A simple smile would have made them looks more friendlier.||The other area we’re not impressed was the services at the coffee house during the buffet breakfast. Granted that we were there during peak period with high occupancy rate but they should have been better prepared for the big crowd. The foods and drinks took way too long to be refilled. And whose “brilliant” idea to offer table-to-table personalised sandwich-making services during the peak period? Just make sure the basics are up to the mark first before offering this unnecessary fancy services.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

首先停車場有EV charger，非常棒（但沒機會用😅就離開了）；

3點半辦理入住很順暢（沒有遇到其他住客投訴般的情況）；

這家hotel被Google標為5🌟，但房間的地毯有一股很重的類似腳氣味的霉味（用香水都無法掩蓋的嚴重）。再檢查了一下其他備品，發現房務沒有提供毛巾，我只能到門外和房務人員索取，外籍房務員很友善（這很明顯是房務部經理在把房間交給櫃檯時沒有做好自己的工作）；晚上外出回到房間，又發現浴室沒有腳踏毛巾，一家合格的飯店應該會提供吧…？已經很累也懶得打電話到櫃檯請人送上來了……

除了以上不好的，其他都還可以，尤其是它的地理位置。不論是開車或是搭MRT都可以去到多間購物商場，非常便利。

房間的價格算合理，但如果不是因為隔天行程安排和目的地的地理位置問題，我想以同樣的價格，我會選擇住另外一間更常住的。","Royale Chulan Damansara"

I stayed at Royale Chulan Damansara from 13–14 December. The room itself was acceptable; however, the check-in process reflected serious operational shortcomings.

Although the official check-in time is 3:00 PM, I only received my room key at 4:27 PM. This was despite being informed shortly after 3:00 PM that a room was already available and being asked to collect my key. I joined the queue at 3:11 PM, with only two to three guests ahead of me, yet the process took over an hour due to inefficient coordination at the front desk.

This delay caused me to miss a scheduled makeup appointment and disrupted my preparation for an important evening event. No proactive explanation or meaningful service recovery was offered at the time.

The following day, a modest late check-out request was initially declined and only approved after further explanation, despite the significantly delayed check-in.

I understand the hotel was fully booked; however, high occupancy does not justify missed service standards or inadequate recovery efforts. Based on this experience, the overall service did not align with the expectations set by the hotel’s reputation.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Ain Nurintan","2025-12-13T12:00:05.418Z","1","Selangor","Extremely disappointing and unprofessional experience at Royal Chulan Damansara.

On 13 December 2025, my family and I arrived at 1.00 PM for check-in, having booked seven rooms. We were informed the rooms were not ready and were asked to wait until 3.00 PM. We waited patiently. At 3.00 PM, the rooms were still not ready, and no clear explanation or apology was given.

What followed was six hours of waiting in the lobby. Room keys were released slowly and inconsistently, and the final two rooms were only handed over at 7.00 PM, and only after we raised our voices in frustration. It should never require confrontation for guests to receive what they have already paid for.

Throughout this entire period:
•	There were no sincere apologies from front desk staff or management.
•	The General Manager did not properly address the situation and was seen walking past without acknowledging us.
•	No refreshments or proper seating arrangements were offered, despite children and elderly family members (including guests in their 80s) being present.
•	Front desk staff openly discussed housekeeping failures in front of guests, which was highly unprofessional.
•	Other hotel guests looked at us as though we were not paying customers, which was humiliating.

The most telling moment was that a bell boy showed more empathy and professionalism than the front desk or management by offering us a luggage trolley to sit on. That alone speaks volumes.

This incident occurred the day before a family wedding, turning what should have been a calm and meaningful time into one of stress, exhaustion, and frustration. We chose this hotel based on its reputation and reviews, but the reality fell far short of the standards it claims to uphold.

Regardless of whether a guest books one room or seven, every paying customer deserves basic dignity, communication, and hospitality. Unfortunately, none of these were demonstrated here.

This experience was unacceptable. I would not recommend this hotel based on our experience.

- Update: After receiving the keys, the manager explained that he thought one of us was hotel staff sitting on the floor (because he was wearing black - hence why he didn’t approach us) What kind if idiotic reasoning is this. Then, he further explained that the lateness is due to outsourcing of bedsheet linens that arrived at 5.30PM. Yet, we only received our rooms after 7PM.

Moreover, after entering our rooms, only one towel was provided per room. Is this really a 4 star hotel? Nonsense!","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Trip.com Member","2025-11-21T23:59:59.999Z",,"Selangor","I booked this hotel because I had to attend a conference at One World Hotel and it costs a lot more to stay there for 2 nights. This hotel has designated parking for customers, and is only few min from the other hotel I had to go. It is located near the curve, Ikea and IPC which makes it very convenient for us. Location and parking availability wise, it’s perfect. Ambience of the hotel is good too. Looks fancy and nice. The room was a bit old but really spacious and I love the deco too. The only two unfortunate events was that we had to wait thirty min ish to check in even though we arrived at 6pm. We were only given our access card around 6:35pm but we were not reimbursed with a late checkout. The other time was a lift breakdown around 10pm when hub wanted to pick me up but no signage were put at our floor. Hub waited and ended up walking down ten floors worth of stairs 😂 only to find out that the lift broke down. Anyway, it was resolved by the time we reached back at the hotel. Breakfast was basic but good enough to fill our stomach. Overall I would give a 4.5/5 for this stay.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

When I asked a staff member to clear a table, she appeared indifferent and disengaged, offering no greeting or smile. Fortunately, another team member responded promptly and courteously, preparing a table swiftly and professionally.While the parking fee was minimal at RM4, complimentary parking for overnight guests would be a welcome gesture and help streamline the arrival/exit process. Additionally, clearer signage is needed to indicate that the car park entrance is located behind stalls set up along the usual access road, as this caused some confusion.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

I bought voucher during MATTA fair and reserved one month early prior to my stay, confirmed by email. during checkin, they ask for the voucher. however, in the confirmation email, there is no reminder plus in the voucher itself also didn't stated that voucher must be present upon checkin. nevertheless, they let me checkin but need to present the voucher before checkout. later they whatsapp me the same reminder with additional info; if I failed to present the voucher, I'll be charged with a walkin rate rm300 (company policy they said). I have a long chat in the WhatsApp on how unfair that is to charge twice for the stay. finally they explain if I paid the 300,the voucher can be used another time. if they explained earlier about that, the long conversation will not exist. fortunately, my house is around 20mins from the hotel and I retrieved the voucher. my point is, kindly inform early the guest on the voucher usage and your company policy. please state in the voucher and confirmation email to bring along voucher upon checkin.
Next, when I pass the voucher to the counter after breakfast, the lady counter smirked and chuckled at me. if you cannot respect people who bought your voucher, don't offer voucher next time. I am utterly disappointed. this should be long enough.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

I immediately informed the staff, but there was no proper response or follow-up from the management. This shows poor handling of a serious food safety issue.

Even more frustrating, I did multiple written complaints to management but theres no proper follow up from their end.

I hope the hotel takes this matter seriously and improves their kitchen hygiene and customer service — no guest should ever experience something like this.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Not a 5 star hotel and very deceiving as stated! At most 4 star! We stayed at the premium suite. The room is like u go back in time with old decor n furnishings with 2 old 32"" tv although its clean.

2nd day evening is where e nightmare begins! The room is crawling with cockroaches on the walls, floor and we have to go around trapping and smacking them.

Aside from that, hotel has a small gym compared to a regular condo gym. The equipments are poorly maintained. There is also a pool which is chalky n poorly maintained. I advice guests not to swim in it and just look at it as u may fall sick. There are no steam room or sauna like other regular ""5 star"" hotels!

The premium lounge is unlike other 5 star hotels too the food is never topped up and have very very limited options. My entire life this is e least options of all e 5 star hotels i have stayed in. My regular condo clubhouse has a more exclusive feel to it then this 5 star lounge. Dont bother going there.

Breakfast is good but 99% crowded with India tourists so it can get pretty noisy from all the yelling and they have very special seating for them, normal or premium club guests are not allowed to sit there or e servers will stare at u n make u feel uncomfortable.

Last but not least, we truly regret our stay here and decide not to continue our stay here and move to Sheraton hotel and about the same price for a club suite. Its wonderful and we feel the exclusivity compared to this hotel. We will NEVER stay at this hotel anymore for our future trips in future.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Honestly the worst service I have encountered for a 5 star establishment.

Stayed in early Sept, and on the last night at 2am, a pipe burst on our floor, causing water to flood into our rooms. When we called reception to ask what was going on, they only mentioned a pipe had burst and are trying to rectify it. No apology, no change of room was offered despite us mentioning that our rooms carpet floors are soaked. When we opened the door, we saw the opposite 2 rooms and the room beside us all had towels placed at their doors, except us.

Checked out the in the morning, floor smells of damp carpet and when we left the bed, it was so unpleasant to walk on and pack. Utterly ridiculous.

What made it worse was when we checked out and mentioned our experience to front desk, the staff had no idea what had happened or seem to know that a pipe had burst on our floor. Asked for a refund for the last night, staff said to follow up.

Sent an email that very same day, no reply from them despite sending another few, days apart.
Called in and spoke to the staff regarding my issue and a refund, all promised to follow up the next day but nothing was followed through. They have my name, my number and my email. I've called in on 4 separate occasions and until now, empty promises of having someone call me back with updates are still not fulfilled.

It has been almost 2 months, this is utterly ridiculous.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Irfan Ahn","2025-10-13T02:48:19.068Z","5","Selangor","I recently visited Hotel Royal Chulan Damansara to try out their breakfast buffet, and I must say—it’s one of the best value-for-money breakfast spreads I’ve come across. At just RM29.90, the variety and quality offered are genuinely impressive.

🍽️ Wide Array of Local and International Dishes
The buffet caters to both local and Western palates. You’ll find classic Malaysian staples like nasi lemak, complete with fragrant coconut rice, sambal, and condiments. For those craving something heartier, there’s spaghetti and other hot dishes to keep you satisfied.

The bread section is extensive, featuring everything from sliced loaves to muffins, with a toaster station for that perfect crunch. If you’re a cereal fan, they’ve got you covered too—with options like Honey Stars, a nostalgic local favorite.

👨‍🍳 Live Cooking Station – Eggs Done Your Way
One of the highlights of the buffet is the live cooking station, where a chef prepares omelets right in front of you. It’s not just omelets—you can request your eggs however you like: sunny side up, half-boiled, scrambled, you name it. Watching the chef work adds a lively, interactive touch to the morning experience.

🫓 Roti Canai Heaven
Another standout feature is the roti canai section, which offers a variety of roti options. From the classic roti telur to the crowd-favorite roti sarang burung, you can place your order and enjoy freshly made roti served hot. The sarang burung variation, with its nest-like presentation and egg center, is especially popular and definitely worth trying.

☕ Final Thoughts
Whether you're staying at the hotel or just dropping by for breakfast, this buffet is a hidden gem. The ambiance is relaxed, the staff are attentive, and the food selection is both satisfying and diverse. For under RM30, you get a full breakfast experience that rivals more expensive hotel spreads.","Royale Chulan Damansara"
"Jono Chong","2025-10-13T02:34:50.524Z","4","Selangor","We check in to this hotel from 2 to 6 Oct.

Its quite affordable per night for a 5 start hotel, given that I paid abit more I get the breakfast included. The breakfast had a Wide spread. Variety of options. Which was excellent. Every morning with almost different menu. For the rooms. I arranged for a superior king with twin beds. Our stay in the room was good. Had a filter water cooler for us to fill our bottles

However just needed to point out an unpleasant experience that without it would have made my review 5 stars no doubt. So here it is.
When we step into our room for the first time. I wanted to use the bathroom. However, the lights were not working. (Tried all options to rectify the situation but could not fix it) Called in reception for help. But only came up 15 mins later. We had to deal with this when we had other plans outside. So the staff said it was power trip and turn the lights on from the circuit box. We thought it was fixed already when other nights, it switched off again which we had to stand up on a chair to switch the circuit box switch on. But then the switch kept switching off when we tried to switch it on. After a few times it worked. I mean this is first time this happened. Think it happened at least 3 times. Staff offered to switch rooms. But we were already so comfortable in our rooms.

Felt that the hotel should have done a better job in checking the rooms. Making sure everything is good. Not saying its ready then when we checked in to the hotel, things don't work. Its a 5 star hotel, we Had our expectations. But other than the 3 nights. The lights did not switch off again when we were using the bathroom. Imagine that moment...","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Bilik bersih, luas & lengkap, ada meja kerja, aircond sejuk, tilam empuk (jenis yang kalau baring terus lupa dunia).

Bathroom pun bersih & water pressure kuat, love that!

Sarapan buffet dia paling AU suka, variety of foods, ada nasi lemak, omelette station, roti bakar, buah, dan kopi panas yang betul-betul kaw. Tak terlalu banyak pilihan macam hotel besar, tapi semua cukup & sedap.

Staff semua polite & cepat respon bila tanya. Parking pun senang, cuma kalau waktu event / weekend, boleh jadi penuh sikit sebab ramai guest luar datang makan di kafe hotel.

We checked in close to midnight and were given Room 463, located at the far end of Level 4. Although the room was spacious with wooden décor, our first hour was spent catching cockroaches near the toilet sink. We encountered a total of five.

The next morning, we found yet another cockroach, this time on the TV console. That was the last straw. We called reception and requested a room change.

We were moved to Room 412, but the issues continued. The pillows had an unbearable smell, as if they hadn’t been changed in a very long time. It was disgusting and made it impossible to sleep.

Overall, this was the worst hotel experience I’ve had in Kuala Lumpur.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

We had booked the Studio King room, which came with a kitchenette. It was on first floor. Hotel has vintage aesthetics and is located on Jalan Conlay road, and walk able to Pavilion mall, Fahrenheit mall, Bukit Bintag street etc .

The hotel has a very big and grand lobby , your jaw will drop once you enter . Its a quite a small walk to reception desk , I will say. The location is also perfect ,just a few minutes walk from the city center yet peaceful and surrounded by greenery. The check-in process was smooth and the staff were welcoming

The room was spacious enough for two people, clean, well-furnished and with a very high ceiling . But, room lightning could have been better. It was bit dimly lit in my opinion. Moreover,  housekeeping maintained cleanliness throughout our stay.

The restaurant , Warisan Cafe , served food from multiple cuisines- Chinese,Malay, Indian etc ,all had different section, with the veg section in the center of the restaurant. Sitting was comfortable and staff was attentive. The only minor issue was that the veg options were very few, but no complaints with taste.

Overall, Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur offers great value for money for a 5 star rated hotel, with friendly staff, good food, and a relaxing atmosphere. I’d highly recommend it for anyone visiting Kualalumpur .","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

● Thumbs up to the superb, attentive, polite, efficient and excellent manager, ALEX, for ensuring the ""private"" space was re-arranged to a long ""island"" layout to accommodate 21 of us for a comfortable function, tables were wiped clean and the floor was swept/mopped.
● Thumbs up to the manager, ALEX, who arranged swiftly for the complimentary cake from Warisan Cafe and made sure that our needs were met.
● Thumbs up to the manager, HERRY, for making rounds on checking that everything was going on accordingly, and for his politeness when in conversation.
● Thumbs up to the waiter who was assigned to us, JOYNEL, who was efficient, polite, attentive, concerned and helpful.
● All staffs of Warisan Cafe had smiles on their faces, and, were warm and courteous.
■ Hi-Tea spread, quality and taste were GOOD! (*however, live kuetiew cooking could have been better if it was not salty, chef!)

However, the guest rooms really need an upgrade. The furniture and fittings are outdated, and the faucet even came off while I was using it. Housekeeping also missed cleaning my room on the second day, which was disappointing.

Dont like dishonesty. From tap broken, no water, shower tray broken, no lights,  tv broken, send me to occupied  room with guest inside, ask me wait till 6pm for other room, when room ready before 3pm. Took 1 hr to change to other room. No apologies. No calls. Worst experience from staff and room. Treated badly a customer for 15years. Not good feeling. Dont like dishonesty. Trust is broken. Staff need to be honest. Customers coming for many years. We know. Staff that are helpful, honest. Think many staff not even employed since I coming many years. Honest mistake, stress, busy, unfriendly etc I ok. But lies, unwilling to help, not calling, keep waiting etc I not ok. This is service issue. Customer feel not taken care of. Lousy feeling.

Update: Fully agree with management response. This is very unusual, in fact this has never happened before. So many years. All good.

I usually share suggestions only for the hotels I truly like, because I want them to become even better.Another very important thing I would like to mention about the rooms is that, please clean and renovate the restrooms.

But this time was very disappointing. We were given a room with aircond problem. We feel warm and my child was sweating all the time.  Hotel engineers visited and found no problem at first only the window is opened ask us to wait for a few hours first.  The room was still warm at night.  My baby can’t sleep and keep on sweating. At about 10pm there was an electric cut off.  The current was back normal after 10 mins and cut off suddenly again and normal back a few mins again.  We called and the engineer come again.  He said there was another room guest cause the electric cut off. Just then the engineer also found the room was still warm and can’t found what’s wrong with the aircond.  Then only he ask us to ask the front desk to change the room for us.  Front desk said there was no king bed room for us anymore but we claim that we have baby and we need king size bed anyway.  They said they had offer the baby cot to us(as we request when the time check in ). But the baby cot was shacky and old and it’s not suitable for baby sleeping inside.  We wait for almost half an hour more then only we get the new room with lower floor.  We can smell the smoking smell when the time we enter the room but at least the air cond is cool and comfortable.  The desk was full of ants.  🤣We didn’t ask for housekeeping or changing room again as baby was super tired and need to sleep as it’s ald near to 12am. The next morning we went for breakfast. We had to find the seat by own but not serve by the waiter.  There was an extra room with seat but the aircond was not on.  The coffee house was crowded the food run out fast but it was not refill on time.  The only things need to be praise is they allow us to check out a bit late as the baby sleeping.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

The back counter guys were not even trying to ""traffic control"" and had my queue overtaken by other guests that just walk over even though I was already standing there.

The room was okay except it being HAZARDOUS and NOT SAFE for living. There first was a hole in the chair that they gave. I tried to find why there was a hole but didnt push too hard. So I tried to be cautious in case there was a screw or nail causing that hole. I was too tired and wanted to give them the benefit of doubt that it was just aesthetic but unfortunately at that evening, when i was sitting down, my hand automatically landed on the hole and for sure there was a screw. It punctured my palm and the blood didnt stop bleeding for a solid 30minutes (which was the time i tried to squeeze out my blood in the bathroom, took the lift downstairs to get saline wash and bandages and come up to my room again). The manager in charge promised to get back to me on the matter, due to our schedule not able to fit into the next day. But it has been 3 days and nothing.

Imagine if it was a child or another person sitting on that chair. It would have caused a worse injury. I didnt want to make this big but due to your management negligence and incompetence of providing a safe place to stay for your customers, i will have to post this here. Although your team took immediate actions to replace the chair but the damage has been done.

I am not saying this to bad mouth nor defame but it is just very unacceptable and not professional for a hotel of this status providing such DANGEROUS living/resting equipment to your customers. I was not informed enough that I should have just went to ED and get a tetanus shot or even make a report about the safety issue of your place. Now that I have checked out, I doubt your team will even bother for such claims and issues.

The picture shown is only a small dot of blood but that is because i have just wiped it off. The blood did not stop and no i do not have any blood conditions.

No replies, not picking up calls, unsafe environment. I respect confidentiality and will let your management handle the appropriate actions but for your records, my stay was dated 20 September 2025.

I do hope those that are checking out on the reviews will be fully aware that this may happen to you as well. So stay at your own risk.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

The hotel is beautifully designed, with an elegant lobby and warm ambience that immediately creates a welcoming atmosphere. The location is very strategic, right in the heart of Kuala Lumpur and close to major attractions like KLCC and Pavilion.

The staff were exceptionally friendly, helpful, and professional. They made the entire experience smooth and enjoyable, always ready with a smile and prompt assistance. My lounge was spacious, clean, and comfortable, providing a great place to have  meetings.

The event lounge where the AGM was held was cozy, well-organized, and perfect for formal functions. The setting was elegant, with comfortable seating and excellent facilities that made the event run seamlessly. The food served during the event was absolutely delicious, beautifully presented and full of local and international flavours.

Overall, Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur provides the perfect balance of comfort, service, and convenience. It’s an ideal venue for business events, conferences, or a relaxing city stay.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a refined yet welcoming hotel experience in Kuala Lumpur.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"alec ng","2025-10-15T21:35:45.263Z","3","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Expressing my dissatisfaction regarding the poor service and unacceptable attitude of one of your room attendants during my current stay at Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur, after so many visits here.

I returned to my room, Room 440, at around 5:00 PM, only to find that the room had not yet been made up. I then approached the room attendant’s cleaning cart to request for a bath towel. The attendant, who was not wearing a name tag, responded rudely and unwillingly provided only one towel, stating that I had already received one in the morning. When I asked when my room would be made up, he simply replied “later” in an unfriendly tone.

For your reference, I had turned on the “Do Not Disturb” sign at around 10:50 AM (after returning from breakfast) and switched it to “Make Up Room” at about 1:10 PM. Despite this, my room still remained unserviced by 5:00 PM.

My main concern is twofold:

1. Service Delay: What is the standard operating procedure (SOP) when a guest switches from “Do Not Disturb” to “Make Up Room” in the afternoon, yet the room remains uncleaned for after four hours?

2. Staff Attitude: The rude and dismissive behavior of the room attendant was completely inappropriate and unprofessional. Such conduct is not acceptable, especially in a hotel that prides itself on hospitality.

I have been a regular guest at your hotel and have never complained about room defects (lights, tv, power plugs) or cleanliness (stained linen, unclear rubbish), however, the unpleasant attitude displayed by this room attendant today was disappointing and unacceptable.

I urge the management to review the behavior and suitability of this particular staff member, as such attitude reflects poorly on the reputation of Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur.

Yours,
Dzul","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

It was concerning that a room in such condition was still made available, causing unnecessary inconvenience.

Secondly, I found the breakfast selection to be quite limited and not up to the standard I expected from your hotel.

Most concerning was the lack of assistance from the reception staff during check-out. As a pregnant woman, I specifically requested help with carrying my luggage and to safely store it as I was not ready to check out yet. Unfortunately, the two female receptionists on duty were unhelpful and dismissive. I was initially told to carry my bags myself, and only after I walked away did they offer to assist. This lack of empathy and professionalism was very disappointing.

We chose the Royal Hotel expecting a comfortable and welcoming experience, but sadly, this was not the best experienced.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

While the property is a bit older, it is well maintained and still in good condition, which adds to its charm rather than detracts from it. The classic architectural design complements the slightly aged building, giving it a sense of character and elegance that modern hotels sometimes lack.In terms of experience, the overall stay was pleasant and comfortable. The facilities were clean, and the service was attentive. The food, while adequate, was just average compared to expectations, and could be improved to match the otherwise high standards of the hotel.Overall, Royale Chulan KL offers a memorable stay with character, ideal for those who appreciate a blend of history, comfort, and a central location.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

After coming back this time I will NEVER return. The room was full of cockroaches, the carpets looked like someone had been murdered there or had relieved themselves.

The water in the bathroom sink and shower tasted like something was wrong. Everytime we turned on the air conditioning it caused us to sneeze during hours.

Also, there was mushrooms growing out of a service door on the 3rd floor. When we told staff all they did was break it and leave the half broken mushrooms in the same place.

This hotel should not be a 5 star hotel, and in all honesty we stayed at 4 star hotels in Malaysia that were 100x better. The lobby looks nice but the rooms arw absolutely horrible.

The swimming pool is accessible from 4.30 pm to 6.45 pm, and Muslims can swim as long as proper attire is worn. The staff were very kind and helpful in guiding us. Breakfast was served at Level L — for me, it was okay, nothing special.

The suite was exceptionally spacious, with two bedrooms and plenty of room for the children to play and move about comfortably. It was so large that they could literally run in circles, which kept them happily entertained while we relaxed.

The setup made it ideal for a family stay—everyone had their own space, yet we could still enjoy time together in the shared living area. Having two bathrooms also made things so much more convenient, especially during the busy morning routines. The rooms were well-kept, comfortable, and provided everything we needed for a pleasant stay.

The hotel’s location at The Curve is another plus point, with easy access to shopping, dining, and entertainment options just steps away. This made it effortless to head out for meals or pick up things we needed, without worrying about long travel times.

Service from the staff was warm and attentive throughout our stay, which made the whole experience even more enjoyable. Overall, the Family Suite at Royale Chulan Damansara offers great value, comfort, and convenience for families looking for a relaxing and memorable staycation.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Breakfast start at 6.30 but some dish not even ready when I was there at 7. Nasi lemak and curry chicken taste bland. Roti canai is like a piece of rubber. When I asked the bell boy at the main entrance for direction to Pavillion Shopping Mall, he told me just walk straight from hotel main entrance and pointed the mall just across the street whereby pedestrian can't even cross the street. You need to walk much further down the street to use the pedestrian bridge. I later found out there is a shorter route from hotel back entrance to the mall with a proper hotel signage showing the direction when I was walking back. I believe this bell boy purposely showing me the longer route direction. The management need to look into this matter and there is no smile or greetings from the staff too. Only the valet parking guy is friendly.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Заявленных халатов не было. Набор для душа - это три микро-бутылочки (шампунь, бальзам и гель), которых с трудом хватит одному человеку на одну помывку. Сантехника вся старая, унитаз древний, гигиенический душ самый дешёвый, старый и распыляющийся во все стороны, а слив расположен на прямом уровне, в итоге вода из туалета не уходит никогда. Завтраки подаются азиатские - шведский стол с выбором китайских и индийских блюд. Классической и/или европейской еды просто нет. Питались булками.

Everything was ok. No major issues, but not the best stay either.

The linens were a little stained, bathroom was clean but very old. I didn't like that toilet was so far from the shower area.

Pool was small.

Service was good but not great. The spa is no longer active even though on the website it says it is. (You'd have to go to Urban Retreat in the Curve, which is a great spa)

Location was superb tho, cos it's a 3 minute walk (would have been even better if the connecting bridge was still usable) from the hotel to the Curve which is then connected to IPC and also Lotus.

Overall good stay. if you just need a clean, comfy bed to sleep and easy access to nearby malls with good food and nice grocers and easy on the wallet, this is it.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Location is near to shopping mall and easy to locate. Value for money if have discount. Parking is LPR system but you still need to validate at reception and pay RM 4 per entry. Not convenient for hotel guest that need multiples in and out. Room and facilities are quite old (estimate more than 10 years). Out of three lifts from main lobby to rooms, only one lift is working. Hotel didn't provide towel, only delivered after requested.

I arrived late that morning and was trying to quickly get the necessary food before the counter closed. An Indian gentleman, who appeared to be supervising the area, tapped me on the shoulder to remind me that the food had to be consumed within the restaurant. I think he made a strong assumption that I intended to take the food away, which was not the case.

He then informed an Indian female staff member, who intermittently monitored me throughout my meal. This created an unpleasant atmosphere, and I felt rushed to finish. As soon as I mentioned that I was done, she immediately cleared the remaining cakes and roti prata from the table. I can only hope that these items were not intended to be reused the next day.

I believe hotel customers should feel warmly cared for, rather than closely monitored. I hope the Management will look into this matter to ensure a more comfortable and respectful dining experience for future guests.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

"wingster1","2025-09-11T23:59:59.999Z",,"Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Forgot to check the reviews when i booked this for a business trip.  The hotel is a bit dated as the reviews state and a make over is needed to be called a 5 star hotel.  Based on the 4 star i stayed in Singapore before, this would be closer to a 3.5 star hotel.|| Not all is bad. I had a massive room on the 6th floor which was nice.  Hot water fine, clean, no smells.  The only part of the room that was not 5 star was the wear and tear on furniture, small amounts of mold in the show grout and the air conditioning unit that was old and a bit noisy.  Safe was there, ironing board and water bottles always topped up.  Not sure why house keeping trying to do room before 9am?||The rest of the hotel was fine. Decor dated but clean. Pool looked fine and small gym. Breakfast was fine.  The was a mix of offering from continental to indian, Chinese and local.  Good chance to experience other foods from around asia for those embracing the experience.||Location was excellent as only a short walk to the main shopping area.  There are building works right next to the hotel now and while my room was the opposite side, if located near the building site area i can understand the issues.  This building impacts on other hotels there too. There are two ugly tall  buildings incomplete from covid the other side, next to the Pullman and Banyan hotel. One assumes you are out and about seeing things so it should not affect a tourist stay.||There must be some cheaper rooms as many of the guests staying are not what you would expect at a 5 or 4 star hotel.||THEY DO NOT SERVE ALCOHOL IN THE HOTEL.  Not sure how you can be 5 star and remove the option from customers?   This is their choice and reflects the main customers they have and I had no issue.  Respect the culture of the country you are in.  Plenty of bars around outside so not an issue unless an alcoholic.||Staff very friendly as expected.  I had a good stay and enjoyed it especially as so cheap.  This is the thing to consider, other 5 star hotels will be 2 to 3 times more expensive.  For the price, this hotel worked well. £70 per night plus tax in 2025!  Manage your expectations when that cheap.  Needs modernisation to get 5 star.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

✅ Les points positifs :

L’hôtel est très spacieux, presque comme un palace.

Le staff est souriant, serviable et chaleureux.

À l’occasion de la fête de l’indépendance, on nous a offert un délicieux thé tarik, une belle attention.

Les chambres sont propres et le style général est élégant.

❌ À améliorer :

Je n’apprécie pas personnellement la moquette.

Certaines fournitures en bois et équipements de salle de bain mériteraient un rafraîchissement ou une rénovation.

Les portes ne se ferment pas automatiquement, il faut penser à vérifier derrière soi, et certaines semblent un peu datées.

👉 En résumé : un bel hôtel spacieux avec un service attentionné et une ambiance élégante, mais qui aurait besoin de quelques rénovations pour être parfait.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

However, there was poor communication among the staff either in reception and/or housekeeping.1. Late check-out till 2pm was granted to 1 room while the other 2 rooms till 1pm after we made a call to the hotel. When the access cards were sent for validation, was told all 3 rooms extended till 1pm only. Beyond that, subject to extra charges. Was told no record in the system that there is prior approval for the special extension for one of the room. Nonetheless, this exception was still granted but only after we made another call to the hotel.2. Payment for extra bed has to be made first before the bed can be set up. This was fine. Paid before we left the hotel for the day. However, after we returned to hotel at night expecting the extra bed ready for us, were disappointed to find no extra bed. Apparently it was sent to the wrong room despite having specified which room it was to be sent to. Payment for extra bed was to come with extra towel and toiletries for the third person but these were not provided despite the earlier assurances that it would.3. Low marks for amenities - old hotel and the rooms assigned to us really do need refurbishment! Pretty run down condition. Overall, still a pleasant stay due to its convenient location.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Very near to each other. We chose Damansara as we felt it was worth the money and it was only about 4 mins walk to the curve. In fact we were very impressed with such beautiful hotel at reasonable price. The receptionists were all polite. Parking is convenient and it was RM4 per each entry.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

A lot has been said about such silly policy as whether you get in at 12 or at 3. The hotel still has to provide due service per stay. You don’t get a discount when you check out early do you?Room was missing hand and face towel. Didn’t think much of it till I clarified upon check out. While I could have called down, it is basic checklist that all amenities including towels and more are provided. Why does a guest need to call down for service that is due? You won’t expect to go and collect your food for in room dining would you? Cleanliness is decent. Though the facility does need some refurbishment as things are starting to rot and peel. There is also a lingering stagnant smell in the air. Hotel is located walking distance to the mall and IKEA. An MRT station is also not a far walk away.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Trip.com Member","2025-07-26T23:59:59.999Z",,"Selangor","The price was quite reasonable for the room and location. However, this is marketed as a 5 star hotel, and it definitely is not up to par for a 5 star hotel in KL--I would consider it more like a 3.5 star hotel level. When checking in, they tried to double-charge me the tourist tax, and I had to prove to them that it was already collected by the booking site. Then, I got to my room and found that the soap and shampoo were totally empty, and the safe was not working (replace battery error), and there was some rubbish still in the room. I called and waited for them to come address these issues, and saw that the ""premium herbal"" soap and shampoo in the shower was refilled by a worker carrying used water bottles filled with generic soap and shampoo. Again, I don't really mind too much except that it felt like the 5 star label was very fake, and this was a 3.5 star hotel trying to hope nobody notices these things. But, the price indeed was a 3 or 4 star price, so I don't feel ripped off--just misled. Rooftop infinity pool had a nice view, and fitness centre was outdated with some broken equipment--but sufficed. I would stay again for a business trip in the area, but would set my expectations accordingly.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

This hotel is NOT one of them. First time staying here and the moment I stepped into the cold and uninviting lobby, I knew I was going to be disappointed. Waited a while for the receptionist to sort out my booking even though I had pre ordered and pre paid. No welcome drink for a 5 stars and I waited with flies buzzing around you in the lobby.

The lifts, the walkways were old, dirty and dusty and you can see many cracks along the wall panelling. The room, while neat, was extremely dusty and dirty, due to overusage and time. The carpet, especially at the edge of the room, was thick with dust and the toilet looks like a public toilet. Bed was really old with no top layer and not really comfortable.

Breakfast was decent though with good selection. In the evening, I went to the smoking bar and it was empty with no staff to service. Overall while the hotel is huge, the deco is cold and uninviting. They desperately need a renovation and frankly they should be downgraded to a 4 or 3 stars. Thankfully, their prices already reflect that.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

The downside is the check in is after 3pm and some cars were not validated for parking. Youre supposed to be charged at RM4 flat rate but turned out to be charged at RM25+. When you intercom, they will ask you to leave your car at the basement, go upstairs to validated your car number. Dunno why they couldnt just verify it via the intercom.

Staff were very friendly and helpful from check in to check out. One of the rooms we were initially given had a terrible smell to it (we guessed it was water from the carpet near the bathroom) and the staff were nice enough to upgrade us to better rooms on the 7th floor that had wooden floors and balconies.
The location of the hotel is perfect, easy walk to Pavilion mall and other places.
Only negative for me was the breakfast - the choices, though it seemed a lot just didn't cater to the majority and quality of food i thought was below par. So much so i didn't bother going after day 2 of our 7 day stay there even though I'd paid for it.
I recommend this hotel as rooms are big and spacious, with good swimming etc as long as you don't mind that it's a bit old and can do with modernising overall but it's well maintained.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"Trip.com Member","2025-07-14T23:59:59.999Z",,"Selangor","I recently stayed at this hotel and had a generally pleasant experience, though there are some areas for improvement. The room I stayed in was spacious and clean, which I appreciated. However, the furniture felt a bit outdated. It seems the hotel has made some refurbishments—such as fresh paint on the walls—but a more complete upgrade would enhance the overall comfort and appeal.The water pressure in the bathroom was excellent, but I found the amenities quite basic—only two bath towels were provided, with no face towels, which was a little disappointing.One of the main reasons I booked this hotel was for the kids’ club, but unfortunately, it was closed during my visit without any prior notice. Additionally, the pool area appeared to be undergoing some upgrading works; I noticed some parts of the flooring had been removed. While it’s good to see maintenance being done, there were also a few dead insects in the pool, which raised some concerns about hygiene.A final point worth noting is the change in accessibility to nearby malls. The hotel used to have a direct link bridge to the shopping mall, but now the bridge from the first floor connects only to the Mutiara Damansara MRT station. Guests now have to walk about 350 meters via a sheltered path beside the road to reach IPC Mall, according to Google Maps.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Checked in for a short stay at Royale Chulan Damansara, and here's my quick (but royal) breakdown:

Parking:
Let’s start with the obvious — plenty of parking, so that’s a win. But before you get too excited, you’ll need to pay for it. I think it’s RM3 per exit? Not a dealbreaker, but also not exactly a warm welcome gift. Could’ve at least thrown in a “welcome mint” or something.

The Room:
The rooms? Big. Spacious. I got a king bed and it felt like sleeping on a badminton court — huge.
Classic furniture and finishing, a bit of old-school luxury charm. Honestly, it works… until you realise the toilet has a window. Yes. A window. Between the toilet and the bed. So, if you’re staying with a friend — prepare for eye contact you’ll never unsee. Be ready for that peep, when you poop. You can use blinds though, which still allows 5% exposition.
On the bright side, the shower and toilet are in separate cubicles, with a big sink and mirror area in the middle.
Layout: weirdly functional.

The Vibe:
Corridors are long. Like, marathon-long. First-timers might feel like they’ve entered a maze built by an interior designer who once got lost in IKEA. The whole place has a classic, slightly dated style. My two sen: maybe do a few modern floors, see if guests go for them. Royale Chulan 2.0, anyone?

The Highlight (Seriously): BREAKFAST.
It’s the main event. Huge spread, local to Western, and it’s everywhere. This isn’t your sad buffet with 3 trays and half a toaster — this is a full-on food fiesta. If you're booking, get the breakfast. If you skip it, I don’t know how to help you. You’ll just watch other guests waddle out with teh tarik and regret.

Other Things People Seem to Like:
The mall next door (The Curve) — convenient for shopping or grabbing extras.
Ice skating rink nearby (if you're into falling gracefully).
Friendly staff, with that polished hotel service feel.

Often used for conferences, so business travellers seem to dig it.

Verdict:
If you're into classic hotels with generous space and top-tier breakfast, this place is solid. Just maybe avoid sharing a room unless you're very close — or into open-concept pooping. Your call.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Room service guy tried to enter room with master key at 12:30 AM.

He ring bell twice and directly used master key to open the door.

Luckily I was awake and certainly angry on him.

He told me that someone from his team Informed that my room was a vacant room and he came to verify.

Security person called on phone, apologized and told not to escalate this matter as he will ask Hotel  Manager to provide apologize letter next morning.

Till I checkout on 11 AM no apology from anyone. Even help desk who helped to checkout I feel not aware what had happened.

This is really dangerous and risky incident happened as people can easily enter room via master key without any manager.

When I paid RM 360++ per night, I expected imperfections and was more than willing to make some concessions due to the lower price compared to other 5 star hotels around the vicinity. But what I experienced was way WORSE than I had imagined.
The bathroom was full of black mold around the shower head, corners, bath tub and even the tissue box. Seemed like it had been years since it was last cleaned properly.
Everything looked nasty & disgusting. The squeaky doors, soap marked glasses, torn sofa, stained linens, low water pressure, the list goes on and on. I’m amazed they somehow passed their safety checks despite being an obvious health hazard to the guests.

Service? Almost non existent. We checked in at around 10PM. No one welcomed us at the front doors, no such thing as a welcome drink, no music, no baggage handlers, NOTHING! Even the counter was empty and we had to wait for a few minutes for someone to check us in. Hilarious…
I strongly suggest would be visitors to opt for other nearby establishments and avoid this total embarrassment of a so call 5 star hotel.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

I woke up in the middle of the night to find a cockroach crawling under my blanket, which is completely unacceptable for any hotel, let alone one that claims to be 4-star quality. On top of that, the tap water was yellowish, which made me question their hygiene standards.

I made a complaint before check-out time and requested compensation for the unpleasant experience, but the response was totally unacceptable. The Duty Manager, Hakimi, offered a “room upgrade” for my next stay — as if I would ever want to return after this horrible experience. Even worse, they expected me to pay for another room in order to “compensate” me.

In addition, the room I booked was not a regular room — it was an Executive Suite, which cost me extra, yet the condition and service were far below expectations.

The Assistant Manager, Farahida Faric, refused to contact me on the same day to address the issue, showing a complete lack of professionalism and urgency.

This hotel is not worth your money or peace of mind. Poor hygiene, poor management, and zero accountability. Definitely not a 4-star experience — more like no-star service","Royale Chulan Seremban"

A special mention to Mr. Nuh, the engineering technician, who was polite, patient, and genuinely helpful when I had an issue with the in-room hair dryer. His service really made a difference.

That said, the room furniture is quite run-down and clearly hasn’t been refurbished in a long time. An upgrade would certainly enhance the overall comfort and appeal of the stay.

1. 말레이 전통 양식을 이용한 호텔.
2. 오래되어 클래식한 분위기 느끼고 싶으면 좋음.(엔틱 가구들이 세월의 흔적이 느껴짐)
3. 침대가 크고 편안함.
4. 테라스가 있음.
5. 넓은 수영장이 있음.(애들 있으면 테라스가 수영장과 연결된 방에 묵음 괜찮음)
6. 시내라 교통 좋음.
Conlay Mrt역 게이트 B가 호텔 바로 앞에 있음. 구글맵에서 게이트 A알려주는데 B가 바로 앞에 있음.
공항에서 klia transit 타고 putrajaya 역에서 MRT로 환승 Conlay Mrt역에서 하차.  (토탈 MRT 4.3+ klia transit 9.4링깃)

파빌리온 몰까지 걸어서 감. (호텔 나와서 반얀 트리 호텔로 들어가 엘베 타고 올라가면 파빌리온 몰까지 가는 연결 통로 나옴.)
7. 정말 조용함. 세상 조용함.. (에어컨 소리가 좀 남. 줄이고 자면 괜춘)
8. 조식에 중식, 말레이식, 인디아식. 서양식 다 있음. 단, 이슬람 특화 음식(할랄 음식)이라 돼지 고기 요리는 없음.
(식당에서 일하는 직원들 잘해줘서 고마워요.특히 커피 코너 Wasim 씨 친절함에 감사,)
9. 화장실이 넓고 변기와 샤워실 분리. 욕조가 따로 있음.  특이하게 방과 욕실이 큰 창문으로도 연결됨. (모르는 사람과 가면 좀 난감. 가족끼리는 오케이)
10. 욕실용 드라이기 있음. 다리미 있음.
11. 에어컨 리모컨이 없고 현관문에 가서 조절 가능.
12. 방 불이 노란 불밖에 없어서 어두움.
13. 한국인 거의 없음.
14. 늦은 체크아웃 5시까지 하면 150링깃 내야 함. (그래도 공항 캡슐 호텔 한 명 가격임.)
15. 호텔 로비 공용 여자 화장실은 셋 중 하나만 사용 가능. 그것도 청소 안 해 놓음... 로비 화장실을 5성급에서.. 가장 이해 불가.
16. 하루 관광세 10링깃.
17. 스마트 TV아님.

18.늘 쿠알라룸푸르 와서 느끼는 거지만  이 도시는 비즈니스 여행 오는 곳이지 가족 여행 오는 곳은 아님. 다른 동남아 호텔 가서 호캉스하시길....","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

After I entered the room, the room was warm so I went to turned on the aircond and turned it to 16 degrees. However after awhile around 30 mins or so, the room was still warm and not really cool, I tried to turned it on and off again, switched the fan speed but to no avail.

Hence, I tried living it on and I went for a few hours and it was still not cooling at all and finally I tried to turn the temperature to around 30 then only the room was cooling enough.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

It is an old hotel, hence some parts of the rooms are outdated and the sofa chair can be replaced. However, the rooms, the hallways, elevator, lobby, all areas are neat and clean. Parking is easy and free for hotel room guests. The reception will ask for your car number plate at check-in and you can enter and exit carpark anytime and however many times you want. Before entering the carpark, the automated sensor will detect your number plate before allowing you to enter. The carpark is new, clean and felt very safe. There is also a 24-hour convenience store near the reception in the lobby that is self check-out.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

During my recent stay at Royale Chulan Damansara, I was truly touched by the warm hospitality I received—especially from Bazmeer at the lobby. When I needed assistance from the manager, Bazmeer greeted me with such kindness and genuine care, speaking to me as if I were a member of his own family. His warmth and professionalism instantly made me feel at ease.

Not only did he listen attentively, but he also resolved my issue quickly and efficiently, going above and beyond what I expected. I left the lobby feeling deeply satisfied, truly blessed by the experience, and with heartfelt appreciation for his exceptional service.

It’s rare to come across someone who brings such sincerity to their role. Thank you, Bazmeer. I would love to return to Royale Chulan Damansara, knowing there are people like you who make every guest feel so valued.

With gratitude and love,

"Trip.com Member","2025-08-04T23:59:59.999Z",,"Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","We booked two rooms, but only one was ready when we arrived. The second room was only available around 4:55 PM, which was quite a long wait considering we checked in at about 3:30 PM. Thankfully, the hotel allowed us a slightly late check-out to make up for the delay.The Qibla direction inside the room was confusing. Fortunately, we had adjacent rooms and noticed the Qibla markings were inconsistent. It’s best to double-check using a Qibla app to ensure accuracy.We were excited to try the buffet breakfast after reading many positive reviews. However, the food was just average in our opinion. The sambal for the nasi lemak lacked flavor and didn’t taste like the typical Malaysian version which is something international guests might be looking forward to. Cantoneese noodle, ommelete and tosai superb. Overall, it was a decent stay. The staff were friendly and helpful.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

The room was spacious and cozy, with all the basics I needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was super comfy, and I slept really well since the whole place was nice and quiet. The décor leans a bit traditional, but it added to the charm, and I loved that my room overlooked some greenery – it gave a nice relaxing feel even though I was in town. Plenty parking spaces available with LPR entry and exit.

Breakfast the next morning was definitely a highlight. The buffet had a good mix of local Malaysian dishes and Western choices, and everything I tried tasted fresh. I really enjoyed the pastries and made-to-order omelette . The dining area was bright and welcoming, so it was a great start to the day.

Overall, Royale Chulan Seremban felt like a solid choice for a short getaway. It’s not a brand-new, trendy hotel, but it’s comfortable, peaceful, and has great service. For the price, I’d say it’s definitely worth it, and I’d happily come back for another stay if I’m in Seremban again.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

Our room was spacious, clean, and tastefully decorated with modern touches and traditional Malaysian charm. The bed was incredibly comfortable except for the pillows not very comfortable can  and we especially loved the large windows offering beautiful views of the Damansara skyline.One small area for improvement would be the pillows and bes linen they seemed quite old and could definitely benefit from an upgrade to match the overall comfort of the room.

**1. Rude and Unprofessional Staff**
The front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. Check-in took forever, and they acted like they were doing me a favor by letting me stay. Requests for basic amenities were met with blank stares or delayed responses.

**2. Dirty and Run-Down Rooms**
The room was supposed to be a ""luxury"" stay, but it was far from it. Stained carpets, dusty furniture, and a musty smell made it feel more like a budget motel than a 4-star hotel. The bathroom had mold in the corners, and the towels had an odd, unpleasant odor.

**3. Broken Amenities & Poor Maintenance**
The air conditioning barely worked, leaving the room uncomfortably warm. The Wi-Fi was slow and kept disconnecting. Even the TV had issues—half the channels didn’t work, and the remote was faulty.

**4. Overpriced for Terrible Quality**
For the price they charge, I expected so much better. The breakfast buffet was mediocre at best, with limited options and stale pastries. Room service was slow, and the food arrived cold.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

This kind of behaviour is unacceptable, especially from a hotel of this standard. It left a very negative first impression and added stress to the beginning of our stay.

"rakesh sharma","2025-07-16T01:55:21.736Z","1","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","I checked into Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur around 10:40pm last night, expecting the usual standard of excellence I’ve come to trust from this brand. I’ve stayed at Royale Chulan in Seremban, Damansara, Penang, and even London; all of which have consistently delivered a wonderful experience.

This is not my first time staying at Royale Chulan KL; in fact, it has always been my go-to hotel whenever I am in Kuala Lumpur. Unfortunately, this time was extremely disappointing and unhygienic, unlike anything I’ve experienced at any Royale Chulan property before:

1. My Shirt Got Ruined by a Dirty Iron
The iron in the room left yellow stains on my shirt, rendering it unwearable. It’s clear the iron hasn’t been cleaned or maintained properly.

2. Stained and Unclean Toilet Seat
The toilet seat was visibly dirty and had black marks. This is unacceptable and unhygienic, and should have been cleaned thoroughly before guest check-in.

3. Used-Looking Towel with Yellowish Stain
One of the towels provided had yellowish discoloration on it. I noticed it only after using it and it honestly grossed me out.

4. Empty Tea & Coffee Tray
A basic amenity like a tea/coffee tray was completely empty: no tea, coffee or sugar. This is a bare minimum that even budget hotels get right.

5. Filthy Bathroom Floor Towel
The floor towel had blue and grey stains, looking like it hadn’t been replaced or washed properly.

6. Unsanitary Toilet Floor
There was a repulsive stain on the toilet floor, which had clearly not been cleaned before my arrival. Totally unacceptable.

7. Dead Insect on the Floor
I even found a dead insect on the room floor, which points to poor pest control and a lack of basic cleanliness.

8. Leaking Shower Head & Poor Water Pressure
The shower head was leaking badly, causing water to splurt in multiple directions and significantly reducing the water pressure. Taking a shower was frustrating and inefficient.

I brought this to the attention of Karthik at reception during check-out. Instead of showing concern or offering even a basic apology, he told me to “leave a review on Google.” So here it is.

I’ve always been a loyal guest of Royale Chulan and had great experiences at all other branches, but this KL location severely fell short. I sincerely hope that management takes these issues seriously and addresses the obvious lapses in cleanliness, housekeeping, and customer service.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"Dhivya Raj","2025-07-28T11:58:39.620Z","2","Negeri Sembilan","This hotel used to be good in the past. Lately the standard seems to have dropped.

Issues we faced:
1. The room:
We stayed in room number 510. The shower hose was spraying water in every direction from a malfunctioning connection, causing the whole bathroom to be wet and slippery.
2. Covers of the bathroom fittings (towel hanger, floor trap for tub) were loose and kept falling off. Even the towel hanger behind d door had fallen off with visible holes.
3. Toilet bowl started malfunctioning on the 2nd night and ended up becoming fully clogged by the 3rd day. Poo could not be flushed in and caused the whole room to stink up.
4. Bed creaked every time you move on it. It was so bloody noise and we literally slept without turning for fear of the noise waking our baby daughter.

The restaurant:
1. Went for dinner - ordered a lamb chop well done a fried rice with egg well done and a hot milo. Had to repeat the order almost 3x.
In the end i was given an ice chocolate. Only after making noise it was changed to a hot chocolate. Lamb came raw and when we tried to explain it to the waitress she brought the chef out who told us he is not well versed in cooking western food. Why do you have it on the menu if u cannot provide it?
The egg that was asked to be welldone came out bullseye and had to be sent back. And the dishes were tasteless - totally not worth the price.

Swimming pool:
Green water and so poorly maintained.

All in all, I wouldnt recommend this hotel and I would suggest choosing other resorts instead!","Royale Chulan Seremban"

Imagine having to repack everything after you have settled down and not able to rest just busy with the Aircond. They don't find it troublesome. Accept it or check out, no compensation. They simply just disregard my management complaint. In my opinion, their service is declining.  Royale Chulan KL is no longer what it was.Additionally, I don't recommend their dinner buffet as well.

However, this year and the last have been the most disappointing stays we’ve ever experienced. Unfortunately, the condition of the hotel has declined severely in both cleanliness and maintenance.

Here are the issues we encountered during our stay:
•	Cockroaches were found in the restaurant, in the coffee mugs, and even in the hallways. We even stepped on them while walking.
•	Bathroom towels were torn and had an unpleasant, musty odor.
•	The bathroom had a bad smell, and cleaning staff only replaced towels without actually cleaning the bathroom.
•	The water in the bathroom had a strange and bad taste.
•	Bedding was not changed—just rearranged. The same comforters and pillows were used daily.
•	Dirt was visible under the beds, under nightstands, behind the curtains, and in corners. The dining table was never wiped.
•	Laundry service was poor—clothes were returned still smelling bad and unclean.
•	The air conditioning units in the rooms were broken and did not cool properly, causing great discomfort.
•	Water stains were visible all over the corridor ceilings. We raised this issue multiple times with staff, reporting water dripping from the ceiling, but nothing was done.

It’s truly disappointing to witness the hotel’s standard drop to this level. We used to enjoy our stay here, but now we feel uncomfortable and frustrated by how poorly the property is maintained.

We strongly urge hotel management to take this feedback seriously and act immediately to resolve these issues before more guests face the same experience.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Despite the hotel is old, Rooms are clean, the toilet is also clean except that the shower area can be a bit cleaner. Very big and spacious. Good service. The fridge and iron is broken, but after calling the room service the changed them swiftly, quiet and comfortable rooms. Amazing breakfast with loads of choice. Pool temperature is refreshing, and they have nice jacuzzi. However, the water quality can be cleaner with less leaves in it. Also, there was an insect flying into the water, but it is still not bad anyways. Would definitely be 5 stars if it was newer.

For the health.. we were at the gym n as there was no one we were waiting outside, a man came running. He then guided us into the gym n we had a  good workout. After the workout, my wife wanted to swim n again this was there to guide n look into our safety. While waiting, I walked around the pool n noticed there were so many potted plants planted by this same guy. Looks like he has green hands.  Unfortunately, he has been doing all these with only one hand. The great guy is Selva. Simple guy who works very hard running up n down handling all his tasks.

"Oscar Jon Shing Lee","2025-12-07T14:27:38.602Z","2","Penang","Stayed for a weekend to attend a friend's wedding dinner in early Nov 2025. Overall a very disappointing experience.

1) Upon checking in I realised that they arranged the 2 single beds together side by side. I was sharing the room with a friend so I called front desk to highlight this and requested for a solution. The answer given was ""Oh sir you may shift the beds apart yourself"". I was like what kind of attitude is this? If you can't change rooms for me, at least show courtesy by arranging someone to help shift the beds. Lack of professionalism.
2) After the first night, I woke up to the sound of water dripping. Upon inspection the air-conditioning fan coil unit has been leaking water overnight. Likely a clogged drain pan. Contacted front desk, they only arranged a technician to vacuum the water plus housekeeping to dry the carpet up slightly. No room change offered.
3) On the same night midnight (I've just got back to my room after the friend's wedding dinner), the fan coil unit was leaking again. Called front desk then technician came up to vacuum water again! Luckily the neighbouring rooms were not woken up by vacuum noises. Recurring issue within the same day.
4) The buffet breakfast on Saturday morning was miserable. Large variety of food but none were amazing. Cakoi that had a texture like churros. Doughy roti canai. My friend even felt that the coffee machine milk was going sour. Gave up and went out for local food instead.

Didn't have a pleasant experience and definitely won't be coming back. Lack of professionalism, no permanent solution provided for the FCU water leak and the furniture is rather dated. The only saving grace was the proximity to access the various streets within Georgetown. Won't recommend.","Royale Chulan Penang"

"Perda Bukit Mertajam","2025-12-04T10:05:15.780Z","5","Penang","We recently hosted our Showcase and Graduation Ceremony for Genius Aulad Bayan Baru and Genius Aulad Bandar Perda at Royale Chulan Penang, and the entire experience was truly remarkable. It was an important and meaningful day for our children, parents, and team.The hotel’s outstanding service made the occasion even more memorable.

Our heartfelt appreciation goes especially to Puan Yana, who has been an absolute pleasure to work with. Her kindness, patience, and unwavering dedication were evident in every interaction. She handled each detail with such sincerity and warmth, offering guidance and support that gave us complete peace of mind. Her professionalism, coupled with her gentle personality, made the entire journey smooth and comforting. We are genuinely grateful for her presence throughout this process.

We would also like to extend our deepest thanks to the banquet team, whose attentiveness and commitment were truly commendable. Every request big or small..was met with readiness, respect, and a positive spirit. Their coordination, courtesy, and meticulous service contributed greatly to the flow and success of our ceremony. Because of their efforts, our children were able to shine beautifully on stage, and our parents were able to enjoy the moment with full hearts.

Thank you, Royale Chulan Penang, for providing not just a venue, but a warm and supportive environment filled with genuine hospitality. This event holds special meaning for our centres, and we will always remember the care, kindness, and excellence shown by your team.

Lots of ♥️

The furniture was old and showing signs of wear and tear. On the first day of my stay, my room had electrical trip while trying to use the iron but the engineering team was quick to attend and solve the issue.

The breakfast buffet was rather lack of choices, otherwise taste was decent. During the third day of my stay - during breakfast, one of the hotel’s chef was seen talking loudly to his colleague. Whatever the dispute may be, please be professional as this situation will obviously make the hotel’s guests felt unease.

If you ever stay in Royale Chulan KL and Penang, you will understand how my expectation would be.

Otherwise the hotel is strategically located, near town and with a mall within walking distance. Front desk staffs were polite, attentive and friendly.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

One of its best features is its strategic location in the city centre, within walking distance to Seremban’s charming old town and various local eateries and shops.

While it may not offer modern luxuries, it has its own nostalgic charm and remains a reliable and pleasant choice for travellers looking for comfort and convenience in Seremban. A lovely stay overall.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

"Muhamad Amirudin","2025-11-29T00:30:35.751Z","1","Penang","The room itself was old-fashioned but still manageable. Unfortunately, the real issue was the hospitality. Breakfast was served in a large hall, but because of another priority event, the management was completely disorganized. Guests were forced to share big round tables—more like a wedding banquet than a hotel breakfast. The chef refused to accommodate simple requests, which made the experience even worse.

For the price we paid, we expected genuine hospitality and proper service. Instead, we received poor management and a lack of care for guests. This was our first and last visit here. Think carefully before booking.","Royale Chulan Penang"
"James Wick","2025-11-28T01:50:26.675Z","4","Penang","We had a wonderful 2 night stay at this hotel. Close to eateries, cafes and shops alike.

What truly stands out are the employees. They are super friendly, helpful and they greet you everywhere you go within the hotel.

The breakfast buffet is really good. Coffee machines everywhere along with juices complement the vast array of food. No complaints here from.our group.

The only downside and hence only 4 stars was the parking. They explained to us that it's a one time payment of rm5 regardless of how many times you use the car. You need to scan a specific QR code and follow the simple instructions. However, when we were about to leave for home, the parking system charged us RM10 instead. As we were in a hurry, we didn't bother to sort this out.

"Terry52","2025-11-26T23:59:59.999Z",,"Penang","We picked this hotel because it was listed as a heritage hotel in Georgetown and were surprised by a few things. First, do not be misled by the photo showing the nice front. You actually enter the hotel via an alley and rear car park. If you wanted to walk anywhere, you had to walk down alleys or through the car park. Second, if you like a drink in the evening, bring your own duty-free liquor or find a shop selling beer because this is a dry hotel. There is a big, beautiful bar but it is now a milk bar and has large teddy bears draped on chairs to give it some appeal. Didn't work. I did not see a single person using this milk bar in the six days I was there. The food and staff were very nice, also concierge services were very helpful. Our suite was on the top floor and was large and had a nice balcony with harbour views. Overall, it was a pleasant stay, but I can't get past the idea of having an international hotel but no bar even though it is in a Muslim dominated country. Even in Dubai and Doha, hotels have bars.","Royale Chulan Penang"

J’ai l’habitude de voyager mais c’est inadmissible pour du 5*, (sans doute très bien par le passé).

Tout commence lors de mon arrivée. L’hôtel peine à me réserver un taxi/transport pour le lendemain et me conseille de gérer par moi même en grab, on marche sur la tête.

J’ai eu un dîner professionnel, tous d’accords pour dire que la cuisine est surgelée, de mauvaise qualité.

La piscine était fermée et pas mal d’éléments de la salle de sport « en maintenance ».

Hôtel très défraîchi, aux odeurs d’humidités.

Le personnel n’est franchement pas agréable.

Point positif, chambre spacieuse mais sale, moquette tachée, serviettes ne sentent pas bon, les draps sont troués (marques de cigarettes) et fenêtre abîmée laissant entre l’air. L’air conditionné fait le bruit d’un tracteur.

"Trip.com Member","2025-06-17T23:59:59.999Z",,"Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","This accommodation is one that I would not recommend because the rooms were old and outdated. You are able to get a more newer and modern room for the same price. My family enjoyed the breakfast because they like Indian food. (The puri and egg station is a nice touch). The seating inside with air-conditioning was occupied. I recommend placing fans on the patio. I must say that the check-in was quick and simple. The bathrooms were not cleaned. We booked four rooms and they were placed on different floors. The staff is very friendly but the facilities are outdated and not maintained. If you are a light sleeper then the AC will keep you up and there is no view from your view if you are interested in hanging out in the room. The TV is outdated and has no USB charging port like other modern accommodations. The swimming pool is at the center of the courtyard surrounded by rooms of guests, perfect for getting a little toasty and being on center stage. Well, this is my first and last stay at this accommodation. I recommend the Pullman up the road or Dorsett. I hope this helps when making your decision.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

This hotel offers spacious room, top tier service, and everything you can ask for in terms of facilities and service, And that's not it.The location of the hotel is close to a metro line and is around 10min walk from Kuala lumpur iconic alan Bukit Bintang street that have kuala lumpur top-tier malls including Pavilion Kuala Lumpur mall, While sadly you cant see the Petronas Twin Towers from your room anymore because of the newly built skyscrapers, It is still 10min drive from it, or a 20min walk if your into walking.I Also enjoyed the breakfast offered by the hotel its variety and taste wont disappoint you!","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

I recently had the pleasure of staying at Royale Chulan Hotel in Penang, and overall, it was a fantastic experience. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, and the amenities were top-notch, making for a very comfortable stay.

A special mention goes to the front desk team, who were incredibly attentive and professional. They knew their products well and were always ready to assist with any questions or requests. Their excellent service really made us feel welcome from the moment we checked in. However, I did encounter a staff member, Joel, who unfortunately left a negative impression. His attitude was somewhat rude and unfriendly, which stood in stark contrast to the otherwise wonderful staff I interacted with.

On a brighter note, I must give a huge shoutout to the housekeeping team, particularly Arslan, Siva the Gym staff, who did a tremendous job maintaining cleanliness and ensuring the room was always pristine. His attention to detail was evident, and he made sure we had everything we needed during our stay.

Pls also look into the room and its water pressure, possibly some plumbing issues that you may need to address

In conclusion, I highly recommend Royale Chulan Hotel for its great facilities and outstanding service, though I hope the hotel can address the service inconsistency.","Royale Chulan Penang"

The hotel is clean and beautiful, with a classy heritage atmosphere from the lobby all the way to the room. The staff were genuinely polite and helpful — from the front desk to the café team, everyone provided excellent service and made us feel welcomed.

The room was spacious and comfortable, with everything in place for a relaxing stay.

Breakfast was really good — plenty of variety and everything tasted fresh and delicious. They offered a nice mix of local and western options, and the café staff were friendly and attentive.

The location is very strategic, close to many food spots and attractions around Georgetown. Parking is available; you just need to follow the heritage building layout, but it’s still manageable.

Overall, our stay at Royale Chulan Penang was very satisfying and definitely worth it. With great service and a delicious breakfast, I highly recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay here again.","Royale Chulan Penang"

"C K Teo","2025-06-02T05:39:19.678Z","2","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","This was my second time staying at this hotel, and unfortunately, the experience was far worse than before. Upon entering the room, I immediately noticed several problems:

- **Faulty door lock** – The door couldn’t lock properly, raising safety concerns.
- **Dirty and moldy bedsheets** – The bedding had visible stains and even mildew.
- **Broken toilet flush** – The flush was extremely hard to press.
- **Unstable shower temperature** – The shower tap couldn’t maintain a fixed temperature, as it kept sliding on its own.

I reported these issues to customer service and requested clean bedsheets and repairs. However, after waiting **over 15 minutes** with no response, I had to call again. Another **5-6 minutes** passed before a maintenance staff arrived, only to briefly inspect the room and suggest a room change instead of fixing anything.

The hotel itself is **badly worn out** and clearly lacks proper maintenance. Even after changing the bedsheets, the new ones still had **stains and discoloration** on the pillows and duvet covers.

Additionally, the **parking system** was inconvenient—guests must use a **Touch 'n Go card to enter**, but upon exiting, they have to go to the front desk for payment and scanning before leaving.

Given the **poor condition, lack of cleanliness, and inefficient service**, I would **not recommend** this hotel if you have better options.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Here’s why it’s become my go‑to choice for solo trips, business stopovers, and family getaways alike:||What Makes It Shine| • Unbeatable Location|Steps from Bukit Bintang, Pavillion, and the city’s major business hubs, you can walk or rideshare anywhere in minutes.| • True 24‑Hour Service|Whether you crave a late‑night supper or need an extra pillow at 3 a.m., room service and housekeeping respond promptly—without the dreaded “after‑hours” surcharge.| • Full Five‑Star Facilities|A well‑equipped gym, relaxing spa, outdoor pool, multiple dining outlets, and plenty of secure, covered parking mean you rarely have to leave the property unless you want to.| • Flexible Accommodation|Choose between classic hotel rooms or spacious serviced apartments—perfect for extended stays or families who like a kitchenette.||People Who Make It Special| • Front‑Desk Superstars: Jamie, Naiman, and Kathir greet you like old friends, handle requests lightning‑fast, and somehow remember every guest’s name.| • Voice of Hospitality: Halen (operator) is incredibly warm and efficient—expect your calls to be answered with genuine cheer.| • Honourable Mentions: Though no longer on the desk, I still miss Suzy (Sales), Danialli, and Sukdev—their legacy of excellent service lives on.||The rooms are spacious and well laid out, but some carpets and wall paint now show their age. A light refurbishment would easily elevate Royale Chulan KL from “very good” to “exceptional,” matching the stellar service the team already provides.||For locals seeking a city staycation or visitors wanting a central base, Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur offers superb value, genuine Malaysian hospitality, and every five‑star convenience you need—plus a parking spot waiting downstairs. Highly recommended, and I can’t wait to see the refreshed rooms on my next visit!","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

It may have earned that status many years ago, but the current room quality does not reflect it. For the price charged, the experience was disappointing. This review is purely to raise awareness, as the hotel would be more accurately rated as a 3-star property.

There were several issues observed in the room, including a broken strip and stained bedsheets, among others. Despite having pre-booked our rooms, we were not given the appropriate ones, which further affected our overall experience.

The only positive aspect is its strategic location, which is convenient and accessible.

We sincerely hope the hotel management takes this feedback constructively and makes the necessary improvements to uphold the standards expected of a 4-star establishment, or otherwise consider revising its rating to a 3-star hotel instead.","Royale Chulan Penang"

If I may share some personal opinion 1. Lemon slice water or cucumber mint water is preferable and looks better than cordial juice for welcome drink2. Toilet in my room flushes too hard, causing water to splatter out. It started to smell, so I had attempted tp hose it down - and discovered to my horror, the water doesn't drain through3. Butter fridge doesn't work - would be good to place mini pack butter in a bowl of ice cubes instead4. The you tiao fried on the spot is not you tiao.You are better off having a pancake ala-minute.

The service was top-notch and made everything run so smoothly. To Puan Mahsuri, the Sales Manager, was a true lifesaver during the planning. She was so on top of everything and super helpful with all our requests. She really kind, generous, hardworking and knows her stuff! A big thanks to Mr. Hafiz, Puan Mahsuri's assistant, for his hard work and always being ready to lend a hand. We really appreciate it! Ms. Devika, Mr. Joel, and Ms. Raina were all fantastic. They were so helpful, welcoming and friendly! We can’t forget the kitchen team, either! The food was absolutely delicious throughout our entire stay esp the breakfast. Seriously, a huge compliment to the chefs.  Lastly to all the lobby, dining, hall staff, thank you for being so polite and always ready to help. The entire experience was just brilliant, and it’s all thanks to the dedication of your team. We’ll definitely be recommending your hotel to others. OTHER HOTELS MAY MATCHES THE ROOM CAPACITY AND THE FACILITIES BUT THE PEOPLE MADE THIS HOTEL REAL STANDOUT FROM ANOTHER.

Okay, it is cheaper than most in KL, but two years ago it was an excellent experience and a pleasure to stay. What has happened? What can I say?|Toilet wouldn’t flush. Light bulbs not working, air con not working, tv remote with no batteries, towels all shredded on the edges. Shower not waterproof and spilled out into the bathroom. |The hotel requests you use the safe in your room. We couldn’t. It had been locked whilst open. We got told they couldn’t fix it but they would put our valuables in a safe at reception, which was inconvenient.

When we arrived around 1pm, the male waiter didn’t seem welcoming and insisted we sit at a certain table, even though the entire restaurant was empty. After taking our order, he disappeared, and when we wanted to pay, we had to walk around just to find someone to help. The food also didn’t taste good. Hopefully, the management can really improve both the service and food quality, it’s such a waste, especially given the great location in Penang.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Although the hotel was in the middle of busy Georgetown, they do provide multiple storey carpark which they charged for rm5 per stay. Please add breakfast for your stay cause it was unexpectedly delicious and they offered variety of foods. I did not give high expectations for their breakfast at first cause i've been to royale chuln villa in kuantan and the breakfast was average. Super love their hokkien sup which was flavorful, roti canai which was crispy, their ayam pandan was exceptionally tasty and they got cakoi which finished early. Their room was basic but the bed was comfy and large. The aircond was cold and shower working well. I was touched by their handwritten memo left on table, it was very cute!

"Abdul Raheem","2025-03-14T12:18:33.027Z","5","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Staying at the Royal Chulan Kuala Lumpur was a pretty good experience overall. It’s a beautiful five-star hotel with an elegant vibe, and we booked the superior double bed room. Most of the stuff was spot on, the bed was super comfortable, the washroom was clean and well-maintained, the Jacuzzi was a nice touch, and the lockers were convenient and secure.

But if I’m being honest, the AC was a bit of a letdown. It just didn’t cool the room the way I expected, and in a hotel of this standard, you kind of expect everything to be perfect, especially something as basic as air conditioning.

That said, we still had a great time. The hotel’s atmosphere, the service, and the overall comfort made up for that one hiccup. Would I stay here again? Probably, but I’d definitely check the AC first!","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Good location, spacious swimming pool and room. You can feel that the hotel is old so a lot of things are not working in the room, for example sockets or lamps.

The staff is polite and helpful, I was provided some space for a meeting when needed.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

The Room Safe was non-operational, pillow covers and bed covers were dirty & worn-out. Even towels were dirty. We had to call housekeeping to replace all. ||The breakfast, though, was nice and very elaborate, with good veg food options (it has a separate South Indian counter). But there was almost no veg food option in room service menu. Moreover, in room service, they insisted on paying upfront instead of adding in room bill which was an inconvenience.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"
"yorkspuds","2025-03-05T23:59:59.999Z",,"Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Arrived here having arrived by road from Malacca.||Impressive, if slightly old-fashioned lobby - and quickly checked in by reception. Up to the fourth floor to room 423. Our hearts sank when we saw the building site next door! But in all honesty we weren’t disturbed by it and the construction workers knocked off at 8pm and didn’t restart until 8am, so no big deal. ||Our room turned out to be the biggest one we had on our trip. Large bathroom/dressing area, kitchen area with fridge and a small freezer compartment, microwave, electric 2-ring hob, kettle with tea & coffee, sink, kitchen cupboards. But note - no crockery, cutlery or pans, or washing-up liquid or T-towels. Just 2 mugs for tea - no glasses either! At most you can re-heat a takeaway.||Large bedroom with table & chairs, desk & chair and a sofa. Bed was comfortable. Two free-to-use safety deposit boxes and two wardrobes plus drawers. WiFi worked well. ||Now, to be absolutely honest, the hotel could do with a big refurbishment. It is  very old-fashioned and rather tatty in places. Only one electrical socket worked in our room and some overhead lights didn’t work. The toilet door didn’t close either! All that being said, it was comfortable and clean and the staff were all lovely. It’s also a low-rise building, with a lot of character and an oasis in the hustle and bustle of KL, and a change from the ever present soulless skyscrapers. |The swimming pool is glorious!||Breakfast : An absolute feast, catering for all tastes, Indian, Chinese, Western- really sumptuous and good quality. Excellent.||Close to Conlay MRT and the Pavilion Mall, the latter having a wonderful food court in the basement - highly recommended. ||So, despite the need for refurbishment, we really liked this hotel. It is truly an oasis in the concrete jungle of central KL.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

That said, apart from the youtiao and soy milk the rest of the breakfast was very good.  The location of the hotel is really good.

Breakfast was included and is buffet style, it caters to most people's tastes / cultures. Fantastic swimming pool, warm salt water variety. Within the pool lies a small pool that becomes a spa like once you press the button.
Close to lots of tourist spots and a huge amount of options for eating out.
Staff friendly and always willing to assist.

"Ioana Cutcutache","2025-08-23T01:18:37.271Z","1","Penang","DON’T TRUST too much the 5* reviews as the hotel is giving free drinks for the good reviews!
I was quite disappointed with this hotel after having multiple issues. First, at check-in they insisted I pay the tourist tax which I was pretty sure I already paid when I booked. Later I managed to find the invoice for that in one of the emails so had to argue with them to get a refund. Then I specifically asked for a room on a quiet side so my young daughter can sleep ok. They gave me a room next to a noisy generator. After 2 nights I had to ask to change as we couldn’t get any good sleep. The guy at front desk promised to give us a room facing the inner courtyard as someone was checking out later. When we came back he said that room is not available anymore (obviously given to someone else!) and he gave us a room facing same way as the original one, just a couple doors down. The new room was also smelling of damp. Didn’t have much choice as apparently no other twin rooms were available. The noise was a bit less in the new room but the smell didn’t go away even after leaving the aircon on for a long time. To make things worse at 10:30pm when we were sleeping they came and rang the door bell several times with a room service order which was for a different room! When I spoke to the front desk manager next day he basically said it’s our fault for not putting do not disturb on! And that they will spray the room…
The safe deposit box didn’t work in any of the 2 rooms and had to ask to get fixed every time. Second time it took very long so had to go out and take all valuables with us since couldn’t wait a couple hours for them to fix it.
This is defined not 4 star hotel service! Wouldn’t recommend, there are many hotels in Penang which would give better service, I chose this one based on reviews but then realised they were bought off.
The only ok thing is the breakfast which is decent.
UPDATE: on the last day also found big cockroach in the bathroom!","Royale Chulan Penang"

The surroundings are clean and peaceful, and the room is comfortable. Although the room may look slightly dated, it is still well-maintained and perfectly fine.

Breakfast was good even though the variety was limited. However, the cereal quality could be improved, as it tasted quite cheap — even my son cant finish the cereal because the taste was terrible. We hope this can be improved in the future.

Check-in and check-out processes were smooth and hassle-free. The restaurant staff during breakfast were very friendly and attentive.

The beach is absolutely amazing — we could easily spend the whole day there from morning until evening. We will definitely come back again someday, and hopefully there will be a special gift or recognition for regular guests.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

There are shops and cafes you can walk to nearby.

One thing I would hope is that the management look into refurbishing as some parts, areas and items in the room looks dated.

Kalau dekat chalet my room 2201 , bilik selesa,bersih, kelengkapan cukup ada iron(paling penting)& ada water dispenser mcm coway ya dekat luar. No need to buy mineral water! Yeay!  Breakfast was okay sebab ada pulut kuning (which is my favourite). Ambience for those yang memang nak rest. I will remember forever masa stay dekat chalet ni sbb after breakfast before checking out ada satu kejadian di mana ceiling dekat balcony area tiba2 runtuh and masa tu tengah lepak dekat balcony and nasib baik tak kena kepala just kena kaki. Alhamdulillah. And the staff were very kind yaa making sure we’re okay. 😊

And disebabkan that kejadian, Mr, Faiza (one of the staff) treat us dinner dekat villa tu pula. Rezeki. And during my stay dekat villa pula what i can say is i can’t buy that moment . Service dorang memang superb. Starting from dealing with Mr. Faiza for booking sangat mudah & harga boleh deal👍🏻, transferring from chalet to villa (they allowed us to stayed at chalet sampa villa room is ready to check in) . Not to forget dorang siap bawak beg kite and letak dalam bilik terus ya. Nak masuk ke villa pun very private ya sbb dorang ade each guests name so sangat safe dan private. My room masa tu 302 ocean suites sangat besar luas dan selesa, bersih, katil dia sedap betul tidur. Breakfast dia sedap banyak gila choices. And definitely will come again to stay dekat royale chulan sbb saya suka customer service dia.

For those yang nak bercuti and nak dapatkan special room rate for chalet or villa boleh cari Mr. Faiza sangat baik . Recommended .","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

I came here for a one night stay for an event nearby. This place used to be prestige due to its connection to the MRT & the mall next door until the mall got closed down. You have to walk around the dead building to reach The Curve mall uncovered at some part. It's gonna be really bad if its raining (luckily it didn't during my stay).

Room:
It is quite spacious & clean. It can fit like 5 people. Its very comfortable to stay in here. Amenities are complete. However, the room i got didn't have a nice chair (as per photo). Even the luggage area got some dirty spots on it.

Nous avons discuté avec eux au bout de 2 jours nous échangeons avec Mr Adil qui met clairement notre parole en doute sachant qu'il pointe eux même le document listant les vêtements déposé.
Il y avait le t shirt, de plus il nous explique qu'il a essaye de nous joindre par téléphone,  limite en nous le reprochant et oui nous sommes pas tout le temps a l'hotel. Et a chaque fois on demandait a la reception s'il avait du nouveau RAS , pas de mot dans notre chambre.
Nous avons demandé un dedommagement, en justifiant avec facture aucune ouverture à ce sujet.
Je déplore que la parole des clients soient mis en doute, et qu'il ne prenne pas leur responsabilité, c'est leur laundry, c'est eux qui liste le nombre de vêtements, bref c'est leur problème.

There is NO FOOD REPLENISH and NO Chef assistance with the Stall Outside. I believe Royal Chulan standard is better than this. We were told the food is being cooked in the kitchen but we didn't see any Chef replenish the food.

However, all Operational Staff on Duty was very cheerful and friendly. Hoping that Royal Chulan can improve this as I remember their Ramadan buffet is delicious. Thank you","Royale Chulan The Curve"

When my car arrive at the reception of the Chalet there is no one to welcome you. There is a big jug of tea for self service. I saw the plaque showing rating of more than 8 from Trip Advisor, my first thought was this must be a purposely mixed up rating of the Villa and Chalet. Please note that these 2 has completely separate entrance. After receiving my room key, i walked up to my room, the stair full of dust and old with many stained marks. The room is a bit cleaner but everything looks very old and shabby. Tiny dressing desk with no light or power point. No slipper, comb, tooth brush in the room. I called up the reception twice to only get the slipper. They don’t have comb.

Chalet’s room however, is very bad! The curtain has molded and the bathroom is very very small despite the charging price. For a price like that, i couldve gotten better room and elsewhere with better accommodities.

View is quite nice. However the food was below mid and below expectations, the menu for breakfast is the same every single day. So there arent many options to be chose from. Buggy service is also very slow. If I call for one, the waiting time for the buggy to show up can take up till 40 mins just for a 5 min ride.

"Amnie Nabila","2025-11-16T04:36:25.700Z","1","Pahang","Hi Team Royal Chulan Cherating Chalet,

I would like to make a complaint regarding our stay from 15 November 2025 to 16 November 2025.

We made a booking through the Agoda app for 3 people. However, upon arrival for check-in, the reception staff (Syazwan / Mastura / Intan — not sure who handled it) did not seem to check our booking properly. They informed us that our room was only for 2 people, and asked us to add on 1 sofa bed for RM60 and an additional breakfast for RM33.

We were very confused because our Agoda booking clearly stated 3 guests. Since we were tired after travelling from KL and it was already late, we decided to check in first and clarify the matter later.

Shortly after that, we received a call from Mastura asking again about our booking and the “sofa bed” request. This made us even more frustrated, as it showed that the first receptionist did not properly verify our Agoda booking.

We are extremely disappointed because:
• We paid for 3 people, but were given a room meant for 2 people.
• The receptionist did not double-check our booking and made us feel as if we were at fault for having 3 guests.
• The overall service made our check-in experience uncomfortable and unpleasant.
• The room provided was clearly for 2 pax, and adding an extra mattress made the room even smaller and uncomfortable.

Although Mastura eventually called us again to adjust the booking and add the extra pax, we remain dissatisfied and disappointed, as we expected a smoother process and a more comfortable experience—especially since our booking was correctly made for 3 guests from the beginning.

We hope the Chalet can look into this matter seriously and improve the check-in process and customer service for future guests.

Therefore, what surprise us also is the receptionist (Syazwan/Intan/Mastura) also don’t give us a key to locked our room. They’re not even concerned our safety. We know this after we checkout, the receptionist ask us about key. THIS IS REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE AND ALSO OUR FIRST AND LAST GO HERE. Apologies doesn’t make anything change.

Thank you for the bad experience.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

So i have been located to another room but there was an event in the next room so i have to keep my curtain closed most of the time. But im trying to be positive, the warmth service from staffs reduce the disappointment. Everyone was super friendly and kind, feel like one big family. All staffs are locals and i love supporting our local friends because interaction they made make me feel like i was back in my kampung. Hotel has an app where you can chat with the staffs directly. Introverts love these. Hotel landscape was maintained beautifully, great for morning walk. The beach was magnificent. It was clean and clear water. There is no direct sunrise or sunset here to see but that also means great to spend time on beach because it was not that hot and sunny. The waves was not really strong, safe for kids. Room was clean, tidy with some juices provided in the fridge. The toiletries shower gel and body lotion smells so good. Water pressure was strong. There's only one thing turned down, it was the pillows. The pillows made my neck hurts next day. They should change the pillows to better ones.
Breakfast buffet was a lot of varieties. Foods are great only that sambal nasi lemak and curry mee a little salty. Fruits served was all fresh and sweet. Macaroni was delicious and drinks was nice too. Lastly, hopefully can visit this hotel again next time.

The location was excellent — close to George Town’s historic centre, street art, shops, and a wide range of restaurants. It was easy to get around and enjoy what Penang has to offer.

The room was clean and comfortable, with great beds and an excellent shower. The air conditioning worked well and was pleasantly quiet.

The gym was good but I feel the pool facilities could be improved, with some food and drink facilities.

The reception staff were very helpful and accommodating with a special request I had, which made check-in smooth. The staff in the restaurant were also helpful when I mentioned I was vegan.

I was however, disappointed that several vegetable dishes — which could have easily been vegan — were prepared with chicken stock or fish sauce. It would be great if the kitchen could avoid using animal products in otherwise plant-based , giving more options to vegan and vegetarian guests without having to prepare something separately.

Overall, it was a comfortable and enjoyable stay with good service and a convenient location. I’d be happy to stay again.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Do you not hear how ridiculous this sounds? Took my time to write this, stayed here multiple times, and once they 'improved' their parking system to plate-based, parking fee is charged! It's not about how much, but the principal in place. You look cheap, as a 5-star. Bring back the free parking for guest! Even Ibis Sri Damansara, a 3-star hotel can provide free parking. Don't you think how embarrassing this is to Royal Chulan brand? Also, the tagline Malaysia Hospitality sounds familiar? Be original, and don't copy other company's branding.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Originally, kami nak Ocean Suite Villa, tapi not our rezeki this time sebab only Family Villa available (agak besar for 3 of us). So we decided to stay at Standard Chalet (Facing Ocean) RM253/night including breakfast for 2 pax.

Check-in process pun senang, before 3pm dah boleh check-in chalet. For your information, guest yang stay di chalet tak boleh freely access kawasan villa, unless for dining at Ocean Restaurant or spa session. Nak ke sana kena request buggy car dekat reception. Tapi jangan risau, chalet guest still boleh jalan ke area villa ikut laluan pantai yang cantik.

Swimming pool hanya ada di villa area boleh dan untuk guest chalet dikenakan charge RM3-5/pax (tak silap saya) dan wajib memakai swimming suit yang ditetapkan.

Overall, I’m satisfied with our stay here. Breakfast was delicious and suits my taste. Cuma part access ke villa agak limited, so kalau nak makan better order via room service (boleh cash or payment semasa nak check out) sebab agak hassle nak dapat permission ke Ocean Restaurant.

Still, it was a pleasant & relaxing stay calm vibe, friendly staff, and totally worth the experience. 🌿✨","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

Even through our car. Need to be parked downhill at the guardhouse area, the good side is their buggies operates 24h, so no worries to commute from outside to inside the resort.

Food were awsome! Their pulut kuning and rendang daging served during breakfast was perfectly cooked and so nostalgic!

Our room - Ocean Suit 308. But the bed is not superking bed size, just normal king size I guess. Complimentary food - keropok! That’s the main highlight for visiting pantai timur 🩵

It would be better if the hotel had a swimming pool for guests to enjoy, especially since it’s not directly facing the sea and the beach nearby is in a cove. These facilities would make the stay more fun and relaxing, especially for families.

The buffet breakfast also didn’t have many choices, which was a bit disappointing. More variety would make the meal more enjoyable.

I also stayed in a villa for one night. The villa had one bedroom, but it was quite small and felt cramped with two single beds. In the living area, there was one queen bed. The villa had two bathrooms — one inside the bedroom and another in the living area, which included a bathtub. It also featured a balcony facing the sea, offering a beautiful and peaceful view with the relaxing sound of the waves.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I brought my corporate clients here for a team building program from 24–26 September, and to be honest, my initial impression wasn’t too high. Being a government-owned hotel, I expected “average and below standard.”

But Royal Chulan Cherating Chalets absolutely proved me wrong. From the moment we arrived, the team carried themselves with such professionalism, warmth, and pride—it turned what I thought would be a normal stay into a truly memorable experience.

Special shout-outs:
•	Faiza (Front Office): Ensured every single pre-arrangement was met exactly as discussed. Smooth, efficient, and reliable.
•	Ainnur (Sales): Incredible attention to detail and fantastic service from start to finish.
•	Shah, Posa & Ridwan (Safety & Front Office): Thank you for your kindness and for keeping our campfire woods dry despite the heavy rain. And Jacky—walking 60 meters just to check on us and ensuring the buggy arrived on time… that’s next-level service.
•	Alif & Hanafiz (Maintenance): Made sure the LED TV and sound system worked flawlessly, turning our indoor sessions into something special.
•	F&B Team: Young, energetic Gen Z, yet their attentiveness and service quality are among the BEST I’ve experienced in Malaysia.
•	Front Office Team: Shah, Suraya, the cheerful young lady with braces, and the rest—you made every interaction a joy.
•	Housekeeping Kakak-kakak: Other hotels in Malaysia should benchmark your standards. Rooms were immaculate, and the care you put in is simply world-class.

Royal Chulan Cherating Chalets, you’ve set a new benchmark for what a hotel stay should feel like. This isn’t just hospitality—it’s heartfelt service. Truly a hidden gem on the East Coast. 🌊✨

On the website specific to Cherating branch, the facilities selection actually took us to the KL branch. I acknowledge I should have looked more carefully but felt a little deceived thinking it had a great gym/fitness centre which is important to our family.
We were disappointed too that the hotel did not serve alcohol. I think this needs to be clearly stated on the website.

The chalet environment is very clean. The queen bed chalet not sound proof at all, you can clearly hear people chit chat, furniture moving & kids jumping from upper floor while we try to sleep early. Room size, bathroom, bed & pillow is ok. Breakfast buffet is just ok. Open vehicle parking without tarmac. Overall base on my experience, all ok.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

"Yura hasan","2025-09-24T11:54:08.997Z","4","Pahang","I recently stayed at Royal Chulan Chalet and overall, it was an okay experience. The place itself was nice, but I do want to point out a major thing I wasn’t expecting—there’s no swimming pool at the chalet. If you want to swim, you have to head up to Royal Chulan Villa on the hill, and even then, the staff told me you’d need to pay extra to use the pool.
This left me really puzzled. The Chalet and Villa are both under the Royal Chulan name, yet there’s such a big difference in facilities. I get that the chalet is cheaper, but it seems a bit off to not have basic amenities like a pool, especially when you’re already paying a decent price for your stay. If they want to keep the Chalet separate from the Villa, they should at least add a pool at the Chalet. It would make a big difference.
On the bright side, the food was fantastic! Everything I tried was delicious, and that definitely made up for some of the other quirks.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

Man schaut aus dem Fenster und sieht den Pool und direkt dahinter den Strand mit dem Meer, genial. Der Pool selber hat seine besten Jahre auch hinter sich. An vielen Ecken und Enden lösen sich kleine Mosaikfliesen und die Liegen bringen keinen großen Komfort, sie sollten besser mal ausgetauscht werden. Das Personal ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit.

"Iman Iman","2025-09-07T13:33:08.165Z","3","Pahang","Stayed in Villa 116 for 4 days and 3 nights for a staycation. Great location, but old facilities.

Pros
- Beautiful view, easy access to a clean and amazing beach.
- Walkable to many activities nearby like firefly cruise and viral cafes.
- Appreciate housekeeping; clean, polite and provided my extra requests.
- Receptionist was helpful and answered all my questions every day.

Cons
- Floor creaks loudly with EVERY step. I woke up my friend in the middle of the night just to go to the bathroom.
- Outdoor bathroom bathtub has chipped off paint, and the drain cannot fully close, so water cannot fill up. Basically, the bathtub useless and unusable.
- Male staff made several thoughtless comments that stuck with me.
1. ""Memang sengaja booking hari Isnin ke?"" - obviously, takkan lah I ACCIDENTALLY booked 🙄 there are better ways to inform me that many shops/attractions are closed in the early week. Maybe focus on what I CAN do instead of telling me I've basically wasted my time and money booking on a Monday?
2. I booked a firefly cruise independently, the second trip, and was quite happy when I got back. Then a staff member decided to make an unsolicited opinion, ""Rugi lah, rugi. Patutnya book firefly cruise dengan hotel. (Proceeds to talk bad about the organizer I booked the cruise with, compared to the one the hotel would've booked for me)."" - Do I need to state how rude this is? I just got back from my trip and I felt good. My happy mood was ruined after hearing this. What was the point of saying all that?

I came to splurge on a quiet and comfortable staycation. Instead, I felt uneasy because as a young woman, the hotel's predominantly male staff thinks it's appropriate to make comments I didn't ask for as though I was their family member. Additionally, the villa I got was ageing and not fitting for the 3k price tag.

Would love to visit Cherating again but I won't make a second visit to Royal Chulan nor will I be recommending it to anybody I know.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

By 8am you arrive, you have to wait for someone to leave the table before being seated. By the time we came back from getting coffee from a nearby store, the PIC just smiled and said, another 10mins. By 8.50am we got the table, the food is mostly gone. Roti canai left the most ugly looking ones, condiments of porridge is finished, even the porridge itself is finished.

I stayed in the Family Villa. The beach is truly beautiful, and the villa is comfortable, although it is showing signs of age. The bathtub was stained yellow, which made it uncomfortable to use. For the price charged, the facilities should be upgraded — or the rates adjusted accordingly.

The swimming pool was unfortunately very dirty, which made it unpleasant to use.

Breakfast, which was mainly local dishes, was disappointing. Although it is stated to start at 7:00 am, nothing was ready on time. I had to wait for nasi dagang until 8:13 am, and the taste was not satisfactory.

The beach area has no seating or umbrellas provided for guests, which was surprising for a resort of this level. Providing these basic facilities would greatly improve the guest experience.

Overall, the location and view are lovely, but the value for money is not there. Improvements in cleanliness, facilities, and service timing are needed.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

Hotel itself is very old and signs of wear is every where. Reasonably maintained. Room is very large and even with extra bed, there is sufficient room to walk about.
Customer service is poor. Starting with reception where I find the command of English lacking. We stayed 3 nights and I needed an extra bed, strangely initially charged for extra bed for a night only. When I inquired about this, the staff seemed bewildered. Eventually paid for the 2 other nights. When the bed was delivered, you would expect that additional towels and such would also be given. Had to ask for 2 of the 3 days we were here. They got it right only on the last night.
We had breakfast included... mediocre standards. First time in any hotel with live station that sunny side eggs were not sunny but burnt.
Will likely stay again as location and room size is key but won't take the breakfast as there are options with nearby eateries.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Trip.com Member","2025-05-05T23:59:59.999Z",,"Negeri Sembilan","I had quite an adventure in a spacious room that, while a bit dated in style, offered some fantastic highlights! The coziness of the space was undeniable, even though the carpet could use a little TLC. I had a bit of fun improvising a way to keep the water in the bathtub since the stopper wasn’t working, but at least the water heater was blazing hot—perfect for a relaxing soak!The bed had its quirks; you could definitely feel the springs, which added a bit of character to the experience. But let me tell you, the view from the window was absolutely stunning, and everything worked perfectly there! They provided a great selection of tea and coffee, just enough to get my day started right.Now, let’s talk about the pool—it was a total highlight! The children’s pool had warm water, making it a great spot to splash around, and there was even a fun kids' corner for some extra entertainment! I can definitely see myself returning the next time I'm in the Seremban area; it’s super convenient for my travels.Breakfast? It was decent and quick, perfect for those on the go. Overall, it was a delightful stay, and I can’t wait for my next visit!","Royale Chulan Seremban"

Well maintained (not all East Coast hotels are)  and with a luxurious finish turned out to be a comfortable stay.  The family villa is laid out rather uniquely,  the main master bedroom is a large king sized bed with a living area set up between the bed and the balcony.  This living area is where we spent most of our time, chatting, drinking coffee and snacking.  The other bedroom has a separate entrance to one end of the living area, with a door and it opens up to a smaller room with 2 single beds.  The good thing is that the master bedroom has a bigger toilet/shower with a jacuzzi,  and the smaller 2 bed room has a WC and shower.  That mkes it a villa for a very comfortable stay for 4 adults.||Ocean rooms are built beside the pool,  next level up are the family villas and further up the suite- villas.  ||Transport by buggy is provided FOC and all you need is a call and the buggy appears within 5 min. ||We enjoyed the time in the living area and on the balcony watching the sun rise from one corner of the beach and the dusk conditions over the beach.  The beach in front of RC is unique as there is a large sand bar towards the sea, followed in wards by a calm pond and then the beach.  Very good for young children to play away from the breakers.||Our villa came with breakfast and contrary to some reviews, it was a very good breakfast.  Breads, cereals, fruits, hot dishes like nasi lemak with condiments, noodles with soup, prata, and our favourite was their turmeric fried chicken.  Accompany this were fruit juices and coffee/tea service from fresh coffee machines.  Live stations prepared eggs any way you want and service was excellent.||For outside meals, you may wish to walk to the south,towards the main Cherating beach for a few beach restaurants serving the public.||Agro||We planned to stay at Raub and getting a good hotel was a challenge as there were so few.  We decided on this hotel because it was new, full time concierge and an ELEVATOR  .  the other hotels did not.||Rooms were functional, clean, all things worked, toilet and shower clean and towels provided.  My only complaint is that the shower rail was up but  missing the shower curtains.||No breakfast but there are coffee shops nearby for your morning brew.||Anika||Recently renovated with upgraded carpets and flooring - appears better than the last time we stayed,  or was it our opting for an upgrade from a standard room.||Clean rooms, full complement of towels, and comfortable beds smack in the middle of town.  This is our third time staying there.|","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

Last year’s review…
Very bad housekeeping service. Our 3 night stays with NO housekeeping. They kept giving excuses for not cleaning the rooms… One of the reason —- they only clean upon request - new company policy (they said).  The next day we hanged at the door for room cleaning… still No cleaning done… ‘sorry’ they said… We have to request for new towels.. No replenish of coffee, tea/coffee etc… No face or hand towel provided…  Pillows are soggy… this hotel don’t deserved 5 stars (as per booking.com hotel stars rating) cockroaches found in the toilet…  I believed it’s okay to cut cost but not at the expense of your brand and reputation…","Royale Chulan Seremban"

While the staff remain incredibly friendly, providing the warm hospitality Malaysia is known for, the overall state of the hotel is a major letdown. Management has severely neglected maintenance and modernization, leaving guests to deal with dust, mold, and outdated infrastructure.||||This hotel was once a Hilton, yet it seems little has changed since those days—except for the decline in upkeep. It’s evident that since Seremban is not a major tourist hub, little effort is made to maintain or improve the property. Unfortunately, this does not reflect the true standard of Malaysian hospitality.||||What makes it even worse is the price. For the same rates, you could stay in a well-maintained international hotel in Kuala Lumpur, making the value here extremely poor. Guests and Malaysia as a whole deserve better. Management should step up and restore this hotel to a level worthy of its name.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

We booked two ground floor rooms for easy access, which was really convenient. Prior to our trip, we contacted the hotel for a surprise birthday arrangement—and they went above and beyond! They allowed us to celebrate at Villa Café, a beautiful restaurant with stunning sea views. It made the occasion truly special.||All the staff were warm, friendly, and very helpful throughout our stay. One suggestion for improvement: it would be great if the hotel could offer luggage delivery service to the rooms, especially for families with kids or elderly guests. Carrying bags to the chalet can be quite a hassle, especially with the hilly layout. This small service would really add convenience—and it’s also a nice opportunity for staff to earn tips.||The villa is located on a cliff edge, offering breathtaking views, while our chalet (a two-floor apartment-style block) was located lower down the hill. Walking to the villa can be steep, so it’s best to take the shuttle provided by the hotel.||The chalet we stayed in had direct access to a private beach—just a few steps away, which was perfect for the kids! Tip: choose a room facing the playground as it’s closest to the beach access. The beach is great for surfing too. Just note that monsoon season (November to February) can bring frequent rain and strong winds, but we still thoroughly enjoyed our stay despite the weather.||The rooms are spacious and clean—each chalet can comfortably fit four adults. The sofa bed is a bit firm, so bringing an extra mattress might help for better comfort. Overall, this is a peaceful and affordable place to relax, with beautiful nature all around.

Certain renovation jobs should be done fast to maintain Royal Chulan images.... Swim pool facilities is for Villa only , for chalet  can use beach and seaside only...for this price should have a swim pool... If charges less than rm200 then is acceptable but the price is higher which u may get better hotel in KL eg Royal Chulan Damansara and Double tree..Thanks","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

Upon check-in, I requested to merge both bookings since the second night followed directly after the first. However, the receptionist refused, citing company policy that doesn’t allow guests to check in for two separate bookings with different dates at once.This was extremely inconvenient, especially for a business traveler like me. Having to return the next day just to check in again added unnecessary hassle to an already tiring trip. The experience was frustrating and did not make my stay pleasant.I won’t be returning to this hotel or its chain. Goodbye!","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Hartmut Erbel","2025-03-31T22:06:58.607Z","2","Negeri Sembilan","Disappointing Neglect of a Once-Grand Hotel

The Royale Chulan Seremban has clearly seen better days. While the staff remain incredibly friendly, providing the warm hospitality Malaysia is known for, the overall state of the hotel is a major letdown. Management has severely neglected maintenance and modernization, leaving guests to deal with dust, mold, and outdated infrastructure.

This hotel was once a Hilton, yet it seems little has changed since those days—except for the decline in upkeep. It’s evident that since Seremban is not a major tourist hub, little effort is made to maintain or improve the property. Unfortunately, this does not reflect the true standard of Malaysian hospitality.

What makes it even worse is the price. For the same rates, you could stay in a well-maintained international hotel in Kuala Lumpur, making the value here extremely poor. Guests and Malaysia as a whole deserve better. Management should step up and restore this hotel to a level worthy of its name.","Royale Chulan Seremban"
"michael choo","2025-03-31T10:40:58.514Z","3","Negeri Sembilan","A nice small hotel that is old and dated. The design is more of the nineties.

The restaurant is facing the pool and the pool is very well designed and is not the conventional square lap pool but with waterfalls.

The hi- tea buffet offers the raya spread of malay cuisines to celebrate the occasion.

The beef rendang was good but very spicy. The chicken rendang was also good. The mutton was also tasty but slightly tough.

The battered fish and spaghetti was average and could do better.

They have a range of salad vegetables for your choosing and individual preferences.

The cooked Cauliflower and broccoli was okay.

The desserts consisted of various local kuih, fruits, ice kacang and ice cream. Many choices for dessert lovers. The desserts were not the best but good enough.

They have teh tarik, black tea and black coffee  as well to wash your pallette.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

However I really like the room, for the price we paid (250+ with breakfast) it's really value for money. The room have separate living area with two seater sofa, TV, small fridge and the usual mineral water and instant coffee. Then you have your bedroom with queen size bed and a separate toilet that you can access from living area or bedroom. Water heater, iron and ironing board also being provided.

But at the end I was given 4th floor and not pool facing. Almost all the thing in the room cannot function well. The sink water flow slow. The shower head water leaking. The wardrobe door disapear and light cannot turn off. The TV also small and aging. It will hang and need to restart. Only got local channels. Nothing to watch. The stain and dirt on walls and carpet everywhere. And also found 1 mosquito in the room. The Aircon also cannot adjust the temperature. Luckily still can adjust the fan. And also found someone smoking on the floor when come out from the room. Really a terrible experience.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Harpreet Singh","2025-02-24T12:39:32.557Z","4","Negeri Sembilan","We stayed for two nights and had a very pleasant experience overall. The hotel is exceptionally clean, both inside and out, and has a dashing appearance. The service was excellent, with well-mannered and attentive staff. The buffet offered a nice variety of food, and the location was perfect—quiet, peaceful, and beautiful, especially in the evenings during the weekend.

Our room was spacious and clean, equipped with all the basic facilities we needed. However, there was quite a bit of furniture, which made the space feel an extra burden Reducing some of the furniture could provide more room, especially for families with kids.

The lifts were very efficient—hardly any wait time, usually less than 15 seconds. We stayed on a non-smoking floor, and the entire hotel maintained a clean and fresh environment. Smokers are required to move outside the lobby to designated areas, which is a good practice. However, smoking in front of the hotel’s main entrance doesn’t reflect well on the hotel’s image, so it might be better to enforce the designated smoking areas more strictly.

The parking arrangement was manageable. Additionally, it might be helpful to modernize the swimming pool area for better experience, particularly for children, and to provide more coverage from the sun. This is just a friendly suggestion to enhance the experience further.

Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay. The food, peaceful environment, and ability to work comfortably made it a great experience. We would happily return and recommend this hotel to others.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

Dead ants fell off the ceiling, bath towel has stains and furnitures were old, wear and tear not fixed.  Swimming pool is not well maintained. Broken tiles and full of sand on the ground. Resting chairs are also broken. Not forgetting room service took 45 mins for order of lekur and ice cream.  It would have been cheaper and faster to order through Grab.

If the room rate was 500rm, I would understand. But for a villa to charge more than 1K with such experience, you may not have guest coming back.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

But when i arrived at the room, there was a dirty plate in front my door, do i supposed to see that during my arrival?In addition, the room i get was not complete with amenities. There was no stirrer to stir the coffee and no bathrobe to relax after taking bath. This is 5 star hotel and you dont have such basic things? And for water, you should prepare mineral water instead of drinking water. The furniture inaide the room also look old.And the breakfast have a lot of variety. I appreciate it, but the taste of food is so-so. The nasi lemak sambal taste weird. Also the noodle soup not prepare shredded chicken. Its not complete. only omelette, pancake and roti canai are delicious. And the last, the toilet at the lobby was dirty like it is not 5 star hotel.In conclusion, i rate this hotel as so-so because it not fulfill my expectations as 5 star hotel.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"YorksPu","2025-02-17T23:59:59.999Z",,"Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Arrived here having arrived by road from Melaka.||Impressive, if slightly old-fashioned lobby - and quickly checked in by reception. Up to the fourth floor to room 423. Our hearts sank when we saw the building site next door! But in all honesty we weren’t disturbed by it and the construction workers knocked off at 8pm and didn’t restart until 8am, so no big deal. ||Our room turned out to be the biggest one we had on our trip. Large bathroom/dressing area, kitchen area with fridge and a small freezer compartment, microwave, electric 2-ring hob, kettle with tea & coffee, sink, kitchen cupboards. But note - no crockery, cutlery or pans, or washing-up liquid or T-towels. Just 2 mugs for tea - no glasses either! At most you can re-heat a takeaway.||Large bedroom with table & chairs, desk & chair and a sofa. Bed was comfortable. Two free to use safety deposit boxes and two wardrobes plus drawers. WiFi worked well. ||Now, have to be honest and say the hotel could do with being completely refurbished. It’s very old-fashioned and rather tatty in places. Only one electrical socket worked in our room and some overhead lights didn’t work. The toilet door didn’t close either! All that being said, it was comfortable and clean and the staff were all lovely. It’s also a low-rise building, with a lot of character and an oasis in the hustle and bustle of KL, and a change from the ever present soulless skyscrapers. ||On to breakfast. An absolute feast, catering for all tastes, Indian, Chinese, Western- really sumptuous and good quality. ||We had a brief look at the swimming pool which although we didn’t have time to use, was a great addition.||Close to Conley MRT and the Pavilion mall. The latter of which has a wonderful food court in the basement- recommended. ||So, despite the need for refurbishment, we really liked this hotel.

Breakfast is just so so. Ordered room service for dinner both nights we were there. The portion is good, taste ok, price is standard hotel price.

From the moment we arrived, the hotel staffs welcome us a lot. Besides, mandarin oranges, angpows, and festive cookies provided in our room. These little touches really enhanced the festive spirit and made our stay feel extra special.

The service was excellent, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a comfortable and memorable experience.

Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a welcoming and festive atmosphere during the holiday season!","Royale Chulan Seremban"

The private beach was my favorite spot even before RC existed. I also loved their pool, where I could enjoy the beach view while swimming. Since it's still monsoon season, I could watch people surfing, which was quite enjoyable.
The breakfast spread was impressive, with a wide variety of choices from local to western selections. The coffee was excellent, and my daughter particularly enjoyed the yogurt and chef's pasta. It was delicious.
My room was clean and spacious, with great water pressure and a jacuzzi in the main bathroom. I appreciated the thoughtful touch like the prayer mat for Muslim guests.
A big thank you to Mr. Faiza Musa for assisting with the booking. The check-in and check-out process was smooth. I will definitely return with my family.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

"Trip.com Member","2025-02-13T23:59:59.999Z",,"Pahang","Pictures of the villa from the web looked picture perfect, moreover with the high rating, but it was far from reality. When priced over RM500 per night for the cheapest room , 1 would expect a certain level of standard. Upon check in, I didn't feel welcomed at the reception, not even a hi lol. The security and the buggy guy were more welcoming and sincere. When entering the room, I was shocked to see the flooring in utter dismay, it was scratched left right center, nobody felt the need to polish it?  AC was visibly dirty, had a slight tinge of musky smell, when was the last servicing done? Ceiling was stained, wall paper was peeling/ bubbling and sofa had a ironing burnt mark LOL. The toilet still had sand at the corners of the floor! Where the heck is the QC and maintenance? TV channels had nothing to watch either. If u look closely at the pictures I've taken, I also noticed the edges of the tiling... Just shows the poor QC and mindset the management or employees have there. Kids pool was closed throughout our stay, bummer. Apparently it was spoiled and in need of repairs. Not sure how long it's been down. Basically there's nothing much for families with kids to do here other than the beach. Beach access wise, the cement stairs to the Beach split into 2... Management waiting for accidents to happen to guests before action is taken? Food wise was ok but not extensive enough. Nothing great either. Overall this wasn't a good experience, in fact it's utterly disappointing. For the price there are definitely better resorts along the cherating kuantan coast. As a shareholder of Boustead, this is very concerning. I would not recommend to family and friends.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

1) The location is superb — close to the MRT, One Utama, Ikano, IKEA, and The Curve.

2) Breakfast was good, and my favourite part was the live station serving omelettes and scrambled eggs. This is a must-have for any hotel breakfast.

3) The room was spacious. Although the wallpaper and furniture could use some refurbishment, I liked the creamy-white colour scheme. The solid wood doors and built-in wardrobe gave a quality feel.

What I dislike:
1) Some of the staff seemed to have difficulty understanding English, perhaps because many of them were foreigners.

2) It was a bit noisy at night. I’m not entirely sure what the sound was, but it resembled a pumping noise.

Overall:
For me, the hotel offered reasonable value for the price I paid. Thank you.","Royale Chulan The Curve"
"tsn WONDER","2025-09-16T00:10:59.609Z","5","Selangor","Just tried the roadside hawker stall at Royal Chulan and it’s definitely worth a stop!

Their Nasi Kukus Chicken is only RM10 and comes in a generous portion – the chicken is crunchy, fragrant, and super satisfying. I also tried the Nasi Ayam Gepuk (RM15) – not bad at all! The fried tempeh is aromatic, and the tauhu is perfectly done – crunchy outside, soft inside.

A must-try is their sambal – it really ties everything together. What I love most is that all the chicken is fried fresh only after you order, so it stays juicy and flavorful.

Even their drinks impressed me – the syrup is thick, sweet, and fragrant. Simple but very shiok! Add on fried Kubis only RM2!

Overall, great taste, freshly prepared, and good value for money. Will definitely come back again!","Royale Chulan The Curve"

We booked a total of 9 rooms. Only downside is its not meant for elderly people. Cause you need to walk up and down the stairs to go to the beach, restaurant & pool. Lucky the buggy able to pick us up from the villa down to restaurant. But still need to walk up and down a few stairs. The view was amazing. Dinner at restaurant was great. Just that waiting to wait for our dinner was close to an hour. Should improve on that. Some of our family members did a room service also waited close to an hour for the food. If you find the food costly, can always book grabfood or get out of the villa & drive around the area look for restaurants. Room and view was amazing! We loved our stay!","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

Waited for an hour for lunch when there was no one else in the restaurant, and when the food eventually came, it was cold and very average. Another example of why Malaysia will never match their neighbours for hospitality.  Just get the basics right first.

"Dewithraa Siva","2025-01-19T03:30:35.083Z","4","Selangor","Two days ago, I had the privilege of coordinating our school event at Royale Chulan Damansara, Mutiara Ballroom. I must say, the food served for the VIP (dome) and the buffet for the guests was absolutely delicious. The mushroom soup with bread was definitely the highlight – it tasted so good!

As the coordinator for this event, I received a lot of positive feedback from both teachers and parents, which was truly gratifying. I would like to give special thanks to Mr. Nozrin, the Sales Manager, who was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. It was a pleasure working with him. Whenever there was a technical issue, he quickly addressed and resolved it, ensuring the event ran smoothly.

I also want to express my appreciation for their staff, Ms. Fiona and Mr. Joe. They were both very helpful, especially when it came to assisting with the ballroom arrangement. They listened attentively to our requirements and offered helpful suggestions based on their company's policies. Their professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile were much appreciated.

While no event is ever without its flaws, and it's impossible to please everyone, the overall experience was positive. We truly felt supported by the Royale Chulan team, and our school management was very happy with how everything turned out.

Thank you to the entire team for your hard work and dedication!","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Sandra Wang","2025-06-23T07:44:10.287Z","1","Penang","Disappointing Experience – Definitely Not 4-Star Standard

We had a very disappointing stay at this hotel. While it’s advertised as a 4-star property, the room condition was far from that. The facilities are outdated, and the room was not properly cleaned — definitely not what you’d expect from a hotel of this rating.

The swimming pool was closed temporarily, but there was no prior notice on the website or during booking. We only found out upon check-in, which felt very misleading.

When we mentioned our disappointment to the manager, as a way to “upgrade” us, he put us to a worse room which out to be facing the back of another building with large exhaust fans running non-stop. The noise was extremely loud, making it hard to sleep. The balcony area was also dirty and covered in pigeon droppings — completely unacceptable.

避雷！整个经历非常糟糕，在酒店改善设施和服务态度之前，绝不推荐入住。 完全影响度假心情。

强烈推荐隔壁的The Prestige Hotel Penang! Highly recommend The Prestige Hotel Penang next door — a true 5-star experience. Rooms are clean and modern, service is profession.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Housekeeping was attentive and helpful to our needs. Water was provided sufficiently. Staff were courteous and attentive, especially those in the banquet and breakfast halls.

Highlights are
1. Walkable to many places in Georgetown, jetties (can go running/catch sunrise since you live so near), Armenian streets, monuments, museums, etc
2. Yummy food right at the doorstep or across the road (NORM Cafe, 2 frenchies, food court!)
3. Short drive from the malls (Gurney, TOP)
4. Feels like a safe and quiet neighborhood

Would be great if:
1. Opening time for door towards jetty side/chocolate shop could be made known.
2. Have some rack for us to put up our swim in the bath.
3. Remove the additional soaps in bottles since there is already some in the bath,
4. Provide liquid hand soap in press bottles so we do need to go into bath to take it.
5. Provide water cooler at main lobby or lift lobby for us to refill if we want.","Royale Chulan Penang"

There's a doorman at the entrance who opens the door for you each time you exit and enter the hotel. Check-in is fast. Room is a bit dated but spacious and clean with adequate lighting. Essentials like toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair dryer are provided. In the closet, you'll find bedroom slippers, laundry bag, iron and ironing board as well as Muslim prayer mat. WiFi is fast and has good connection. Bed is comfy and clean. Good variety at the breakfast buffet. There's an egg station and roti canai station. Decent coffee from the BonCafe coffee machine. Staff are pleasant, warm and welcoming.

Located in a central location with many cafes, restaurants, bars and cultural sites nearby. Little India is within walking distance. Short walk to the colonial style town hall and municipal building. Enjoy the architecture of the 5 foot way of the shops in the vicinity. So many good food within walking distance- Ali Nasi Lemak Daun Pisang, Norm Cafe, OO White Coffee, Kareem Pasembur, Aunty's Gaik Leans, Jason Nyonya House, Chu Char 1st. There are 2 tea houses along Beach St. For mung beans biscuits, Ghee Hiang is just down the street at the end of Beach St.

Highly recommended for the value, comfort, location and hospitality.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Old aged rooms that seems to stick a plaster to prolong it's pain. Small property and for Penang standards food quality is below average for its meals and daily breakfast. Location is an issue that is far from everything and aside to a 7-11 nearby nothing else in the proximity","Royale Chulan Penang"
"Jip","2025-06-16T08:43:49.597Z","4","Penang","I had my car with me while travelling to Penang Island. So, covered parking and security were important during my stay there. The location of the hotel itself was crucial for an enjoyable time. Thus, Royale Chulan was the perfect choice.

After parking in the multilevel car park annexe building, I made my way to the lobby entrance hidden away from the main street facing the hotel. Peaceful. Checking in was quick and easy. With the room card in one hand and my luggage in the other, I searched for my room. Thick carpet in the corridors leading to guest rooms helped to keep the atmosphere peaceful.

I booked a twin bed room. Unfortunately, the view I had was not ideal. Workers cleaning the rooftop of building next door greeted me when I pulled back the thick curtains. Thankfully, the room itself was cosy and comfortable. The ensuite was clean. That night, I had a good rest. The mattress and pillows were better than most.

Breakfast was provided, and it was a long walk from the hotel lobby. The reason is that the usual dining room was being refurbished. In the temporary breakfast room, tables were a little haphazardly arranged. The dishes on offer were placed on both sides of the entrance. Food quality was acceptable.

The hotel is within walking distance to many local attractions. The Esplanade, the Padang, the City and Town Halls, the bus terminal for bus trips around the city, Fort Cornwallis, Beach Street, Clan Jetties, the street art, the lively Chulia and Armenian Streets. Restaurants, food courts, cafes, and convenience stores are within a few minutes' walk.","Royale Chulan Penang"
"milena rubio","2025-06-16T03:38:49.935Z","4","Penang","Royale Chulan Penang has a great location near the waterfront and George Town’s main sights. The rooms are clean, spacious, and quiet, and the pool and gym are nice extras. The buffet breakfast was great, with a wide variety of options including my favourite Roti Chennai. That said, the service felt more task-oriented than guest-focused, something we noticed across Malaysia, like plates being cleared while we were still eating. Overall, a solid stay if you value location, heritage charm, and a good breakfast, but don’t expect especially warm hospitality.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Three out of four of my sleeping pillows had sandy/dirt water marks on them, the forth had the case inside-out, was it changed from the previous occupant? Service is not too bad but could definitely be better 🙂. Made it difficult for me to get my bottled water just because I opted out of housekeeping for the duration of my stay, why? A/c in my room wasn't really adjusting to the temperature stated on the thermostat. Little things here and there not in mint condition but nothing to shout about. Lunches and dinners really left room for wanting, hardly a spread, definitely not ""Penang food"", would have gone out if we weren't so busy, breakfast was only slightly better. Gym had out-of-order equipment; enquired on the first day and was told it would be working the next but wasn't the case even after a few days. Pool is salt-water, seems well maintained, gets crowded because of size. Location is good, walking distance to hawkers, some attractions.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Upon arrival at the reception, they informed me that my requested room was no longer available and offered to switch to a room with two single beds, which I did not want. That was the first bad experience. Then, the air conditioner in our room was faulty, the children’s facility room was dirty and poorly maintained, the staff were unfriendly, and finally, they double-charged my car for parking. The staff initially said it was RM4 per day, so I should have paid RM8 for two days, but they charged more. When I went to the reception to request a refund, they informed me that my car had not been registered by the staff during my check-in yesterday. This is absolutely terrible, and I will never stay here again.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

I was told that instead of moving rooms, housekeeping would send a minibar to my room, but this was not an ideal solution.Furthermore, I noticed that the area around the minibar cabinet had not been properly cleaned, which was disappointing given the otherwise high standards of the hotel.I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration to improve the overall guest experience.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

However, the food was somewhat underwhelming. The variety was decent, but the flavors and quality didn’t quite match the venue’s high standards. While it wasn’t bad, it didn’t stand out as exceptional either.

Our bed in room 3101 chalet was infested with bed bugs. We had to notify the reception at 2am as we started developing itches. We didn’t want to make a fuss in the middle of the night and waited the next day to lodge a complaint. We shared the photos and video of the bed bug evidence to the reception.We were advised to scan the QR code at the reception to leave our feedback instead. It is rather disappointing to be on the receiving end of such hospitality and the chalet team made no effort to explain/speak to us. This has caused a huge distress to us as it did not only spoiled our holiday, but we had to incur additional cost of getting prescription to treat ourselves.  hope the rooms will be property sanitized to prevent similar reoccurrence in future.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

"Ainsley Chan","2025-06-07T09:22:31.473Z","5","Penang","I stayed here for a 5 day church camp.

Meal staff were very alert with collecting dishes. Low-key I was scared because I'd leave a dish on the table to go get some more food, and they'd clear my plate. I'd regret a little because of food wastage + extra dishes for them to wash for no reason.

Poolside one-armed guy was very friendly with the kids. He'd go around helping them pick up balls and encouraging them on their swimming.

The big hall underneath the swimming pool has a chlorine smell for some reason. Air conditioning is always very cold, so those from cold countries will like it.

It'd be nice if they used charcoal / natural sprays instead of those overly fragranced room sprays because my nose gets assaulted every time I return to the room hallways. The air is very dry too, which makes it worse.

Overall it's a good hotel to stay in. For the price and level of service (all the staff are very polite and the security will always open the door for you), it's a good place to stay in. Walkable distance to many tourist spots too. Everything I wrote above is just my nitpicking and I think their staff are all very hardworking.","Royale Chulan Penang"

"Jr Brian Hogan","2025-01-01T09:31:48.659Z","5","Selangor","Strategic location.
1) From the hotel, you can walk to Kidzania within 15 minutes. There was a link bridge that connects the hotel to the Curve Mall via MRT but it was closed during my visit. Hence my family and I have to walk by the roadside (still shaded but you might get wet if it rains) from the hotel to Curve Mall. The Curve Mall is connected to Curve NX (where Kidzania is located) and IPC Shopping Centre (IKEA building) via link bridge so you would find it convenient to go both places.
2) the hotel is around 10 minutes taxi ride to Tropicana Gardens Mall where you can visit Just Farm (indoor animal farm with Alpaca and other animals)
3) the hotel is around 35 minutes taxi ride to Petrosains Discovery Centre at KLCC
4) approximately 20 minutes taxi ride to 99 Wonderland Park

I brought my family to visit all those places above during our stay at the hotel. What a convenience.
Want it to be more convenient for you to go to Kidzania and IKEA? Stay at Royal Chulan The Curve. That hotel is directly connected to the Curve Mall and you can easily access IKEA and Kidzania from there, via the mentioned link bridges.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

Selain itu, pulau ini terkenal dengan warisan budaya yang kaya, destinasi wisata alam yang memukau, serta berbagai atraksi modern.

Jika Anda memiliki kesempatan untuk mengunjungi Penang, saya sangat merekomendasikan untuk menginap di Hotel Royale Chulan Penang. Lokasinya sangat strategis, memungkinkan kita untuk menjelajahi keindahan dan estetika kota Penang hanya dengan berjalan kaki dari hotel.

Saya disambut hangat oleh Security yang membukakan pintu utama dengan salam dan senyuman terbaiknya. Kesan pertama saat memasuki lobi hotel sangat menyenangkan
udara harum, ruang yang luas, serta minuman selamat datang yang telah disediakan. Proses check-in pun berlangsung cepat, dengan staf yang ramah dan memberikan pelayanan dengan sepenuh hati.

Sayangnya, kamar yang saya tempati tidak memiliki pemandangan yang menarik. Namun, kamarnya cukup luas, kamar mandi juga besar, dan fasilitas yang disediakan sangat lengkap. Tersedia kolam renang, pusat kebugaran (gym), serta pilihan menu sarapan yang beragam dan lezat.

I normally do not like to provide review while staying in a particular hotel. But, my first view of the room triger me to comment immediately. It has been a very long time I see a large hotel standard room. Even though I believe this hote had been for some time now, interior style and was kept neat and well. From its room decoration, interior finishes, furnitures, carpet, ceiling and bathroom wares and fittings.

If ever I am back in Seremban, I will certainly stay in this hotel.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

What really stood out was the staff — everyone was polite and helpful from check-in to check-out. The breakfast spread was decent with a good mix of local and Western choices.

The pool area was clean and kid-friendly, which was a big plus for us. Parking was also easy and accessible.

Check in: We tried to check in after 3pm and was told to sit and wait 30 minutes?!

Rooms: Dated rooms. Noisy air conditioning. Couldn't really sleep well and sneezed so much. Skin felt itchy on their bedsheets.

Bathroom: Black mold and broken shower head.

Definitely did not live up to the number of stars it apparently has. Poor quality for the price. We won't be returning.","Royale Chulan The Curve"

"HC Lew","2024-12-28T16:06:16.035Z","1","Selangor","i made the booking couple days earlier. Upon arrival, I was held up for half to an hour at check-in. After finally being checked in, the staff did not inform me about a problem with the payment voucher from the Agoda. Over the next few hours, I received multiple calls asking for the same information. On the last call, I was told that my confirmation email and booking ID were invalid, and I was told that I had been scammed. They insisted that I pay as a walk-in customer instead.

Despite Royale Chulan Hotel confirming that Agoda is one of their partners, they refused to contact Agoda to resolve the issue. I was left to handle the situation on my own. I called Agoda’s customer service, who confirmed that my booking was valid and paid. The operator assured me that the issue had been sorted out with Chulan Hotel and would be settled in two hours. However, the hotel still insisted that I pay as a walk-in guest.

Chulan Hotel deemed the emails and details I showed them as invalid, even though I had made an official customer service call and received confirmation from the Agoda app. By 10 PM, I was still trying to resolve the issue, and on my last call with Agoda, I was told it would be resolved within 24 to 48 hours — but I was due to check out within 8 hours.

This entire experience was incredibly frustrating. I believe both Agoda and Chulan Hotel need to improve communication and liaise properly with their partners. It is unacceptable for a customer to be charged twice due to internal miscommunication.

As for the hotel itself, I would rate it a 1-star experience. The facilities were not up to standard. There were no bath towels readily available, shampoo is empty, the cleanliness was lacking, and the room had two single beds placed together, which essentially made it feel like a queen-sized bed.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Trip.com Member","2024-12-11T23:59:59.999Z",,"Selangor","Bad service. It was supposed to be a stay that my wife and I would enjoy as newlyweds yet smeared by poor housekeeping services on some aspects as I have explained below:1. Unwanted Housekeeping - We were getting ready for our afternoon wedding reception when we had made sure to not switch on the housekeeping indicator because we had left some of our items unattended in the room. As we got back to the room later that evening, we discovered that housekeeping was done and our belongings had been rearranged without our consent. Despite nothing was missing, it made us feel anxious prior to checking and upon finding out someone went into our room without consent.2. Unprofessional and Untimely Housekeeping Services - After we had just got back to our room from our wedding reception only to discover that the unwanted housekeeping had not provided a fresh bath towel to replace the ones they took away. I had called the reception to request for new ones but we eventually had to wait for more than 2 hours and made 3 more calls to reiterate my request. I even went down to the reception to ask if I could retrieve it by myself from them there and then but was refused and told I have to wait for the housekeeping regardless. We had to hold off our shower, were left in the room waiting and our post-wedding dinner reservation had to be cancelled due to this long delay. After 2 hours, we decided to leave for dinner without showering and had told the reception downstairs that we would collect the towel from them upon returning instead of having it sent to our room as there would be nobody to answer the bell. Shortly after, I got a call from the hotel saying the towels had just been delivered to our room. It meant that the housekeeping had entered our room again without consent! Again, we're lucky that no items were missing.I believe such standards of service are below par on what is expected from a renowned hotel brand.Not to mention the condition of the hotel that looked old with peeled wallpapers all over the place and torn lamps which gave a bad first impression. The room carpets also have stains on them.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

We had medication that needed to be kept chilled, and since the fridge in our room wasn’t cold enough, the front desk staff kindly offered to store it in their chiller overnight. We really appreciated their help.

Our room was spacious and comfortable. Just a small suggestion: it would be great if robes and face towels were provided. We wish we could have stayed longer!","Royale Chulan Penang"

The hotel is a bit dated but the room we had was spacious and bright with a nice view of Seremban.
Breakfast buffet is good although the coffee machines seem to need more than a little attention from staff each morning.
I used the gym a few times and it is adequate although it could be improved, I'd suggest adding a water fountain and a bottle of antibacterial hand lotion and also having the studio attached to the gym open for use as an area for stretching or other light exercise.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

The room is spacious and well-equipped with essential amenities such as fridge, hairdryer and coffee maker, ensuring a comfortable stay. Its strategic location is highly convenient, and the check-in & check-out are seamless. Additionally, my room featured a delightful pool view, which was both relaxing and enjoyable.

However, some aspects were disappointing for a 5-star hotel. The TV channels were limited, and the picture quality was often blurry. The room was not soundproof, so I could hear noises from the next room. Additionally, the elevators were very slow, even during non-peak hours. And there’s no internet or phone signal in the basement parking, making it hard to stay connected.

As someone with allergic rhinitis, the air quality in the room aggravated my condition and even progressed to a cough. The moldy smell, likely coming from the carpet, air conditioning, or curtains, was hard to ignore.

On the positive side, I appreciated the strong water pressure in the bathroom. However, I was disappointed that there was no bidet, which would have been a convenient addition.

The only downside is that access to the swimming pool is restricted during school holidays, even though we were willing to pay for it. There are also a few cafes and restaurants nearby.

我们在酒店度过了美好的时光。价格合理，离海滩只需步行几分钟。大家在海滩玩得非常开心，都不想离开。服务很好，工作人员非常友善，客房服务的价格也很合理。早餐一般。唯一的不足是，在学校假期期间泳池无法使用，即使我们愿意付费也不行。附近还有几家咖啡馆和餐厅。","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

We also have a delicious Hari Malaysia BBQ for 27pax (including children/senior citizen) at Villa. The price is very reasonable and got 10% discount.

The arrangement is good, room is clean and good service from staff there. There is a beach behind and easy access for us to go there. No pool but no problem for us 🤣

Safe parking for your car, don’t worry! Very recommended for beach lovers.

"Yogesh Thaker","2025-04-24T04:20:50.200Z","2","Penang","Trust me, when I say that in all the reviews that I do, be it Hotels, Restaurants, Eateries, Road Side Stalls, simply put, any establishments , I have been very honest and at times brutally out coming and earnestly straight forward

There are times when you feel you need a break and the first few things you do is check how you want to reach your destination and where you will be staying throughout the duration of your stay

This time was the desire to visit PENANG after a long absence
Checking through the Hotel Booking App, we decided upon ROYAL CHULAN PENANG

We have stayed in this hotel before which was right after the COVID.
I can still remember the amount of fun we had at this hotel albeit a few shortcomings on the Hotel side

Our expectations were not high, at all this time around as when we booked a room for our 7 nights stay the offer was very good and included Breakfast for 2

After checking in we went to our room. The moment I opened the door, we were greeted by an unpleasant odour
The room had hairs all over the carpet. The dust and grime on the carpet was very evident
Like I said no expectations at all. So silence on our part
As we were leaving for our lunch I stumbled upon one of the House Keeping crew and mentioned to him regarding the smell, dust and hairs
When we came back, the smell in the room was quite pleasant. The rest no need to mention
Our unpleasant encounter started the next day
Despite informing the Reception that we wanted our room to be done as were returning later in the day to rest, the room was not made
Being a Hotelier myself who now train new Hoteliers in Soft Skills, I understand the weekend rush to do the check out guests rooms first
However any requests by stay in guests should also be addressed
We came down to ask the same young Receptionist, SYAZLI regarding the room and he told us it was already in the system. I requested for an update once the room was made at which point we were joined by JOEL VESTOR who promptly replied that they were under no obligation to inform us if the room was made as they have no direct contact with House Keeping. What nonsense!

You are a 4 star hotel. I have witnessed better guests service from a 2 to 3 star Hotels

JOEL VESTOR just shrugged off any further communication and eye contact with me and slothly went to his Duty Desk . Noticing what just transpired, SYAZLI quickly apologised on behalf of JOEL VESTOR. A quirky and at the same time an embarrassing situation

As a Hotelier JOEL VESTOR demonstrated an attitude that is belittling, arragont and unbecoming of a DUTY MANAGER.
I noticed throughout our stay he would be at his desk with his computer and barely any eye contact with guests

MR JOEL VESTOR, come to one of my Classes, I will impart valuable training. FREE OF CHARGE.

From that day onwards, I would tell the House Keeping Crew myself. I got to know them throughout our stay
They were fast, efficient and very courteous
A BIG thank you to
ABANG ZUL , RAJU, SHABIR, KHALID
Best House Keeping Crew

Breakfast was a good with plenty of varieties
The Breakfast Crew were very friendly and helpful

It was indeed a pleasure to meet up with Mr ROHIM. A great personality and a superb Hotelier
Thank you to SEHA too, very friendly and a joy to chat with. Not forgetting a FILIPINA Crew ""SALAMAT PO*

Honestly, it wasn't such a bad stay as we were in PENANG for work related matter from our HOTEL CHAIN HQ

Hotel needs major refurbishment and soft skills were lacking in some of the employees","Royale Chulan Penang"

His service, warmth, and attention to detail are unmatched—even compared to the front desk, who are supposed to be the first point of contact. He consistently delivers a level of hospitality that the rest of the team could learn from. Honestly, he should be leading guest relations. RC needs more like him.

Service crew in the F&B are amazing. Ling at the reception was welcoming.

Aircon in the room is top notch.

However, rooms are starting to feel a bit tired— kettle even had stains. When we asked for extra mineral water, we were told only 2 are provided, though they did eventually give us more. Not sure why they’re so stingy with the basics.

Asked for a hand towel and were told only rooms above the second floor get them by default; unless requested. its just handtowels - which are basic. Same with an extra room key—initial pushback, then gave us one with a reminder to return it.

At checkout, we were loading luggage into the car right at the lobby - a little help would've been nice. It’s all these little things. We’ve stayed here countless times, but the service just isn’t what it used to be.

Overall, still a good hotel, with good value.

Make RC great again.","Royale Chulan Penang"

The hotel breakfast has less variety of food but still value for the money.

The basement parking is available, however, the reception kinda mess up the parking part. They did not send in my car plate number for the hotel guest complementary parking. When I tried to exit the parking, turns out I need to pay for the parking. Luckily, there are hotel staff near the parking exit which I can request the help from them for me to exit without the need of paying the parking.

They WILL NOT send you invoice like the reception told me until you email to them. The good thing is that they response to my email within 1 working day although they sent me the wrong invoice info.

I will still choose this hotel for staying in Seremban although there is some unpleasant experience.","Royale Chulan Seremban"

I had accidentally left my room key card in the breakfast restaurant and asked a male front desk supervisor (in a black uniform with a black tie) to call and check if it was there. Instead of assisting, he simply told me that it was my responsibility to bring the key card to the front desk to avoid an RM20 charge. His response was dismissive and lacked professionalism. A well-trained supervisor should handle guest concerns with proper manners and a helpful attitude. This experience left a negative impression of the hotel's service quality.","Royale Chulan Penang"

I can also say that the employees are well-intentioned and helpful, but it was a bad experience for us. The rooms are bad, the wallpaper is peeling off. There is no phone in the rooms. We had to call the hotel's external line to tell them that the TV was not working. When no one came for hours, we went to the reception and complained, and we learned that they used the Whats Up line instead of the phone line. The breakfast was also below average. The breakfast is aimed at local customers. As a result, I was not satisfied.","Royale Chulan The Curve"
"Imran Haziq Bin Khairul Anuar","2025-06-18T03:28:02.520Z","3","Selangor","I stayed at this hotel for two nights and overall, I would describe the experience as quite average. The highlights of my stay were definitely the food and the service from the staff. The breakfast buffet offered a good variety of traditional Malay dishes, all of which were flavourful and well-prepared. The staff were generally friendly and accommodating, and service requests were handled promptly. Check-in was also quick and efficient which I appreciated after a long day of travel.

However, there were several disappointing aspects that overshadowed the positives. First and foremost, the hotel seems to charge guests for almost everything. There is no complimentary parking even in-house guests are required to pay for it. Additionally, any extra amenities such as towels or blankets come with a charge of around RM5–RM10, which is quite unusual compared to other hotels I’ve stayed at. It felt unnecessarily inconvenient and rather stingy for a hotel of this supposed calibre.

Another major issue is the condition of the hotel itself. While it may have once been considered ‘classic’, it now feels outdated and neglected. The entire property is in desperate need of refurbishment. The wallpaper in my room was peeling, the carpet and flooring were stained and the bed frame had visible damage. It’s clear that maintenance has been long overlooked.

This seems to be a recurring theme across the Royale Chulan hotel chain. There appears to be a reluctance to invest in proper renovation and upkeep, and it shows. Some properties, like Royale Chulan The Curve, have deteriorated to the point where regular maintenance no longer suffices. Major renovations are urgently needed. Cleanliness was also questionable during my stay, with visible dust throughout the room, making the space feel uncomfortable and unhygienic.

In conclusion, while the staff and food provided a pleasant touch to the experience, the overall condition and policy of the hotel leave much to be desired. I hope the management seriously considers investing in renovations and better upkeep before these properties fall further into decline.","Royale Chulan The Curve"

Comfortable room size (stayed at ocean view suite).

Cons:
Check in:
Staff at reception during check in was unfriendly and lack of empathy.
Request for small extra things like bath mat was turn down reason given was the type of room chosen only allowed with one bath mat.
Room svs:
Paid for extra head count but we are not allowed for extra mattress to the least as reason given its not allowed for our room type.
Spa:
Without consent our agreed appointment time was shifted to time of their convenience. Correspondence was not prompt. Need to wait for few hours before receiving any reply.
Cafe:
Breakfast need to book for time slots if 1.30 hr each slot. Even 2 star boutique hotel does not require the guests to book their bfast timeslot.
Different locations of dining to suit their other corporate guests. We were told to have our dinner(a prebook half board meal) in room reason was because the cafe was booked for pte event. Ultimatum given, to have the dinner outside the cafe or at the pool bay without thinking of our mobility issues(2 guests have difficulty in walking) and the warm night as outside only fans is available.
Bfast on first day was at the reception area.            ( reason there was a corporate meeting held at the cafe)
But the remaining 2 days we can have our bfast at the cafe.
To sum up.. we were placed all over the place for our dining with the lack of empathy or guilt.

Special mentioned to Nizam for remedying the situation. He allowed us to have our dining at the right location which it should be.
Let us have the extra mattress for the extra guest(paid extra guest).
Help to resolve and get our spa slot back.
Arrange for super nice last day dinner menu to make up for unpleasant series of events.
Heads up to the cafe team for your wonderful service and the Chef that prepared our sumptuous special dinner …accept for the guy who called and ask us to have out dinner in our room and the guy who refused to arrange our dinning table so that we can eat together and not eat on separate table.
Kudos Nizam and cafe team!!!

This chalets does not have a pool, but you can pay per entry to near by villas since they are the same management. Its also far from chalets resulting you may not interested anymore.

Parking is very limited. But if it full they allow to use Villas carpark nearby.

Room is ok equivalent to the price. Good environment. Room service is ok. Tv chanel is not interesting at all and it's not a smart tv.

Best part? They demanded rm100 for early check in (1 hour early) even though the room was ready to be checked in. Breafast was utter rubbish. Even a road side food was more delicious.

Here comes the best part. The room amenities was missing. After taking bath, standing fully wet, i noticed there's NO TOWEL IN THE BATHROOM!!!!!!!!! AFTER CALLING ROOM SERVICE, WAITED FOR 15 MINS FOR TOWEL, STANDING IN COLD WITHOUT TOWEL.

I requested for a late check out and was collected a deposit upon check in and later when I checked again, was informed that it is only upon availability and can only check the next day because they are running full house. I immediately voiced my dissatisfaction because I was not informed about it when I checked in and requested it. Then they took a while to check and told me I can have a late check out. It is not because I enjoyed the stay, only because I was working and need to go back to hotel after lunch to take a shower and change. And when I requested for an additional towel, again I was informed that the hotel is running full house and couldn’t give additional towel, they can only “exchange” a towel. Again, I was speechless. As a business traveler, I’ve travelled to many countries and stay in many hotels, never once I’ve faced this type of treatment and my request wasn’t unreasonable.

The environment is quiet and relax. Not much activities that you can do there, only swimming or just hang out around the beach.
No alcohol serve in the hotel as they didn’t mentioned in website.

Going to the beach or restaurant you will need to travel with buggy. The drivers and staffs are friendly but the waiting time for buggy might be long.

Overall comfortable trip.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

Arrived and met by a buggy that takes you up to reception and on to the rooms. ||Pool incredible and not sure if we were out of season but both beach and pool were empty during the day. Great location. For the sun as well if you wanted to top up a tan. Family were happy with the pool but as mentioned beware of the jellyfish. Went in the sea to paddle but several large (not poisonous ones) washed up on the beach. Suggest wet suit if surfing. ||A few bars/cafes on the beach but do alternate open days so check before going out. A little limited for choice outside but restaurant was great in hotel ( oceans) with good selection. ||Cherating resort unfortunately seems to have become a bit deserted. Not sure if this was covid related as with most resorts but a lot of hotels are closed and derelict along the whole East coast area we were in. ||Hotel is DRY by the way. You have to bring your own beer if you want one during your stay. ||Really enjoyed being here. Definitely for the more adventurous European family. But a stunning spot. ||Thank you to the wonderful staff.","Royale Chulan Cerating Villa & Chalet (Formerly known as Royale Chulan Cherating)"

It's ideal for beach lovers and those who appreciate the area's natural beauty. The breakfast spread is decent, with a variety of options including local dishes like nasi hujan panas paired with ayam kurma, fried mee, and porridge, as well as English breakfast items like baked beans, sausages, mashed potatoes, a salad section, buns, cereals, an egg station, and desserts like fruits and cakes.

Sampai lewat petang.  So walkin ke restoran order alacarte.  Chicken chop keras & ada part yang tak masak. So so disappointed. Bila complain dekat counter,  dia kata""nanti saya inform chef"" 😶. My opinion if guest hotel not satisfied they should replace it or gift complimentary for guest. Tak pe lah saya bukan VIP 😅
So dinner kami makan luar which is way more better 😋 yumm kenyang perut
Breakfast- not so much choice & tasteless.  After what happened yesterday evening i expecting breakfast should be better but hemmm...
Saya bukan jenis cerewet makan , saya suka makan2 tapi sayang bila makan macam tu.
Hopefully F&B improve 🙏 chef please take note 🙏

Room & bathroom - bilik ok bersih but ceiling cracked every where,  risau pula jatuh 😅,  bilik air ada berbau mcm bau lipas ke lembap ke x pasti lah .... Keluasan bilik ok ada space untuk solat. Sejadah disediakan👍 . Perabot lama tapi ok la dijaga. Tilam x berapa selesa agak keras 🥴 maybe sbb tilam lama kot.

Parking  - free. Area situ malam sunyi.

Ini review jujur saya 🙏 lain orang lain rasa kan.
For me ROYAL CHULAN KL more better","Royale Chulan Seremban"

Bei uns fanden sich schwarze Haare in der Dusche, die Bettwäsche hatte mysteriöse schwarze Flecken, im Randbereich des Teppichbodens befand sich Schmutz, im Flur löste sich die Tapete bahnenweise ab usw. Die Planken um den Pool sind schadhaft und bedeuten eine erhebliche Verletzungsgefahr. Vom Pool aus kann man auch die Alkoven des Dachgeschosses sehen. Dort ist die Dachkonstruktion derart marode, dass der Absturz einzelner Fragmente droht.

The staff is very friendly, breakfast was amazing (may have been different due to Ramadan tho).
Very big comfortable room, sadly the usb connection(build into the wall) to the smart tv didn’t work …
The pool was very nice and towels were provided.
The property in general had a few minor maintenance issues, the main one being the exhaust of the airco being full of dust like it wasn’t cleaned in the last year(s).

เตียงนอน​ใหญ่ดี​ แต่ความนุ่มสบายของเตียง​ ​และผ้าห่มไม่เหมือนที่คาดหวังไว้

The room was clean. I stayed in the Corner Room type for 4 nights. The room layout and functionality were beautiful, well organized, and very comfortable.

The bed was large, but the comfort of the mattress and the blanket did not meet our expectations.

The breakfast was tasty, but the food selection was limited and lacked variety.

The staff provided excellent service, every one of them. They paid attention to and cared for the guests, which was very impressive.

It had a good size fridge and washing machine Very smiley and friendly staff. Good location for central KL for the Pavilion shopping mall and food court. We walked to the twin towers. Buffet breakfast had many international dishes with a wide choice. Lovely pool, which was occasionally taken over by school children (which was the downside of Malaysian school holidays). Our apartment lacked some basic utensils like glass tumblers/wine glasses, tea towel, washing machine powder. Not all the light bulbs worked, as well as the TV. When we arrived there was a brown object on the lounge carpet which was either chocolate or something worse.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"Hock Lye, Khaleel, CHAN","2024-09-23T10:44:02.411Z","3","Selangor","If not for the friendly staff they would have a much lower rating. The service staff are friendly even though it apparent that they are understaffed. Front desk staff are luckier since there are more of them to be helpful. I like their WhatsApp reporting system, since they are responsive and get things done.

Otherwise, this is an old establishment. Facilities and amenities are dated and tired. There are stains, chipped and broken  parts. I even suspect that the aircon and carpet is  mouldy as I started to have a mild allergic reaction.

The coffee we had at the restaurant was not impressive so were the breakfast other took for the few days we’re there.","Royale Chulan Damansara"
"Sandra Austin","2024-09-22T09:50:15.170Z","2","Selangor","Checked in 3 rooms.

First room so dirty. Still instant noodles near the coffee area. Carpet not cleaned and had bad smell. Bathroom had toothbrush but no towels. Had to ask from the cleaners.

Second room was not as dirty as the first but no towels, no toothbrush, and the lamp shade was falling apart. 2 towels came only after we showered and drip dried.

Third room, no toothbrush and no towels. Moderately clean.

After dinner I asked reception if they usually provide hand towels and toothbrush and they said they would send to the room.
It's understandable if something was overlooked and maybe 1 thing was amiss in 1 room.
But I've never paid so much for 3 rooms where you have to ask so many times for just the very basic! 1 star hotels usually at least give a towel when you check in.

The construction happening around the hotel provides a lengthy walk to the mall which is okay during the day but did not feel safe walking back at night.

The buffet breakfast offers a wide variety of local and western foods. Most items were cold and stale. Suggest ordering something fresh from the hot bar. But the french toast was nice. The melon and the coffee was good. I wouldn't recommend much else.

I enjoyed the bed. It was quite comfortable. But that's about all.
I don't think I would recommend or return.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

The attic suite room was fabulous and a great surprise. Entering the room is a small sitting room which leads onto an enormous balcony overlooking the port. Adjacent is the large main bedroom including a desk and dressing table plus a table for luggage. The main bathroom is large with a stand alone bath, and separate large cubicles for shower and toilet. The ceiling is partly open into the attic space above revealing old beams etc. All stylishly refurbished. Location is great close to the historic areas of George town, Little India and the ferry port with some great restaurants nearby.

Disappointing not to find a cocktail bar in such a prestigious establishment.  A gin and Tonic, for those who didn’t partake in the “English Afternoon Tea”  would have been welcome!  Sadly, the “tea” was for two people and not suitable for a lone traveler.","Royale Chulan Penang"

"Vno S","2025-02-23T13:24:01.806Z","2","Penang","Updated review.

I came in at 3pm to check in and the reception was handling the guests very slowly. I came back at 5.30pm to check in and I was still asked to wait so that they can check if the room is ready, i.e for the room that's supposed to be ready at 3pm. Further, on request to check out slightly late, no courtesy from the hotel staff to check if it is possible. Water pressure in the bathrooms were appalling. TV's channel selections were bad. At the age of Netflix and Amazon prime, this hotel still rolls with a few pathetic channels. Time for an upgrade.

Honestly I have no complaints. Everything is nearby and there is parking provided. Breakfast not so rara as others commented tho.","Royale Chulan Penang"

"Sally Pham","2025-02-22T13:42:30.630Z","5","Penang","Let’s be honest, it’s a very reasonable price so you can’t expect the world. It is a little rough around the edges (edge of pool decking coming away, very dusty shelves in the wardrobe and around bed and top of the shower head, a dodgy exterior door which actually locked me out on the balcony one afternoon, a little wallpaper peeling in the hallway - not surprised with the humidity - and the typical 3* hotel black silicone in the shower/flooding bathroom when you have a shower). BUT, the hospitality is outstanding. We had such fantastic service.

Selva greeted us every day with a huge smile and always got a ball out for our son to play with in the pool. If you ever needed anything, it came quickly. There were several ladies in the hotel who were so kind, always playing with our son; Ling on reception was one of them. The breakfast room supervisor was another. Our son wanted to leave each of them a note when we left, he grew so fond of them and called them all his friends. The security on the doors were forever there, opening and closing doors for guests with a smile and were so polite. The breakfast is very, very good, and the location is excellent too. It’s next to a very good food court, and the restaurants and ice cream shop in Beach St Courtyard just next door were good. One of our taxi drivers recommended the food court to us as one of the better ones, so vouched for by a local too. We had a 3 year old and an elderly parent and the location was perfect for our non-walkers, as it was easy to get Grab. Me and my husband are walkers and most places you could reach within 15 minutes, but in the belting heat the taxis were a welcome relief.

The beds and pillows are something I usually struggle with in hotels but they were super comfortable here. Overall we were so happy with our stay and would gladly stay here again!","Royale Chulan Penang"

When you come out the station turn right
The hotel it’s self is in a great place to explore the old town
The room was a great size
The breakfast had had a huge selection and was very tasty.
We had some amazing street food as we walked around the town.

I recently stayed at Royale Chulan The Curve and had a decent experience overall. The location is great, with easy access to The Curve, IPC, and 1 Utama malls, making it very convenient for shopping and dining. The staff were friendly and accommodating, which made the stay more pleasant.

The room was clean, but not too clean it was generally okay, but I noticed some areas that could have been better maintained. The facilities feel a bit outdated, and some minor fixes, like the TV and bathroom fittings, could improve the experience.

Overall, it’s a reasonable choice if you value location, but don’t expect a spotless or modern stay.","Royale Chulan The Curve"

Then we decided to return and stayed for 2 more nights on 28th February room 505, 804 & 805.
To our horror, we were covered with rashes on our bodies and legs after both nights, the shower head was disgusting covered in black dirt and water flow is low due to leaking. Bedsheets stained and smelly pillows. We asked for housekeeping at the front desk and also with extra hand towels twice together with a reminder to the housekeeper of total 3x before we got what we want. Although the housekeeping is friendly, but we don't like the hygiene of our rooms.
To our latest experience, we weren't sure whether we should recommend Royale Chulan The Curve to our friends on the future. Although we stayed in Royale Chulan Damansara before coming to the curve. We personally find that other than the Royale Chulan Damansara is a bit run down but the rest win Royale Chulan The Curve. We hope the management can put in more efforts in all perspective on managing the hotel especially the rooms are the most important to welcome guests and returning guests.","Royale Chulan The Curve"

No free carpark nor at least a flat rate carpark fare for hotel guest. The fare is equivalent to the Mall fare.

Extra request for towel, pillow or other room items will be charged. No issue to charge the pantry items but i find charging for other items are unnecessary.

The room is not clean, especially under the bed and the carpet stinks bad. The room facilities like the phone, TV and furnitures are outdated. The worst part is you have to whatsapp chat the hotel reception if you seek for help/request such as bellboy service since the room phone is not working.

This review is fair since the room fare is not cheap either. You can find other nearby hotels with the same good location with cheaper rate and way better amenities.

"Tim","2024-12-28T05:16:38.341Z","1","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Wow, what a really bad experience from start to finish! Be warned - this was surely one of the worst hotels we’ve ever seen in our extensive travels across Asia.

1. We lost a full afternoon of exploring KL as it took them literally two hours to finally honour our paid and confirmed Agoda booking (and assign us a disgusting room, more on that below). In the meantime, we had to wait in the lobby and chase down four different levels of managers, facing all sorts of attempts to fob us off. Initially, they plainly refused to accommodate us at all. It was only after we insisted to stay that they tried to downgrade us to a four-star hotel somewhere else. Lengthy discussions followed, after which it was suddenly questioned that we had even paid our booking. And then the foreigners’ tax. After (literally) running after different front desk managers, duty managers, room division managers for two hours and showing multiple times our booking confirmation plus proof of payment plus proof of payment of foreigners’ tax, we were finally assigned a room. We were then told that they often had problems with Agoda bookings - but is that the way to deal with a recurring problem then? On the back of your customers? Also, they didn’t proactively offer any sort of compensation for the ordeal and the loss of valuable holiday time - only our insistence ultimately led to them giving us a dinner in the hotel restaurant.

2. To add insult to injury, the room we were assigned was a total disgrace (see pictures). Run down, dark, dirty and with a breathtakingly bad smoke smell. Stained sheets, stained carpets, dirt on the floor, dirt and hair on the bathroom floor, loose appliances, mold… We immediately returned to the reception and spoke again to their room divisions manager. Afterwards, we were given an upgrade to a suite.

3. The suite itself was in a better condition than the first room, apart from some stained bed sheets. However, it was quite noisy from the street, so the sleep quality was mediocre at best. To top it all off, we discovered a dead cockroach on the floor in the morning.

We had hoped for a pleasant five-star accommodation in traditional Malay style in a prime location of KL. What we got at the Royale Chulan was an absolute service nightmare, a lot of frustration and a proof of how shabby and dirty their actual rooms are, with even the suites in dubious sanitary conditions. As a consequence, we would strongly advise anyone against choosing this hotel as there are so many better options around.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional stay we had at your property! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here.

One minor suggestion: we found the pillows in the room to be uncomfortable. Perhaps considering replacing them would enhance the overall experience.

The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, particularly Lin, Devika, and the Malay gentleman (apologies for not recalling his name). Mithun from Housekeeping did an outstanding job and even surprised us with a lovely gesture on our last night.

We look forward to returning to this wonderful property in the future!

Thank you again for the wonderful stay.

다만 주위에 공원말고는  암것도 없어서, 그랩타고 나가셔야합니다.

조식도 먹었는데, 음식 깔끔하고 괜찮았습니다. 저는 8층에 숙박했는데, 룸에서 보는 뷰도 괞찮았습니다.

1.  Room is not ready even though I checked in at 4pm. had to wait almost half an hour before I can enter room. Another family of mine had to wait 2 hours!
2.  Food was terrible. We had group dinner at hotel restaurant (approx. 20pax). For unknown reason, all the chicken dishes are under-cooked (chicken chop, chicken rice etc.). Breakfast buffet is also mediocre, not much taste, not much choice, some drinks has cockroachy smell, half boil eggs has rotten taste (I had stomachache after eating).
3.  Room service is terrible. The cleaning crew only came at 7PM! They only emptied out the trash cans. The wet towels and floor mats were not replaced. I had called the concierge to get replacement towels and was assured they will send new towels, but it never actually came.

入住時檢查房間，房間沒有打掃很乾淨，很多地方有灰塵，浴室有黴，但大部分地毯什麼的看起來還算乾淨
床看起來好像也蠻乾淨的，但後來隔天我右腳腳背和腳踝出現一堆小紅點，再隔一天換左腳腳背也出現一堆紅點，不摸它們的話不會特別發癢，所以不知道是不是蟎蟲咬的，也有可能是蜘蛛? (但沒看到蜘蛛，醒著時也沒有被爬的感覺)

(很抱歉讓大家看被叮咬一堆包的腳背)

住到第三天早上，房間出現從門口爬進來翻肚的小蟑螂(只是翻肚但沒死)，我真的要嚇死

房間還有其他缺點：
1.最致命的是馬桶沖水水量過大，不壓緊馬桶蓋的話水會濺出來外面，即使有壓住馬桶蓋，水還是會噴在馬桶座上（我覺得好髒）

2.吹風機超級小風，要花3倍時間吹

Royale Chulan is another colonial heritage building with its own story. Old is gold some might say. Highly walkable to nearby spots and eateries, you'll find it a good decision to stay here. But of course, nothing is perfect. However, I had a pleasant experience during my stay here.

Great LocationThe hotel is very well located, close to a large shopping mall with plenty of food options nearby, which is very convenient.2. Convenient TransportationThe hotel is very close to the MRT station, making it very easy to get around, whether for travel or shopping.3. Decent CleanlinessThe cleanliness of the hotel is acceptable, but I hope the hotel can consider providing face towels, which would enhance the guest experience. 3. Old FurnitureI understand that this hotel has a long history, but the furniture in the rooms is too outdated and needs to be updated and maintained.4. Iron IssueThe provided iron has a burnt surface, which severely affects its usability and even stained my clothes. I suggest the hotel replace the iron promptly.5. Poor Sound InsulationThe sound insulation between rooms is poor. At night, I could hear the sounds of the couple next door making love, which disturbed my rest. I recommend the hotel improve its soundproofing measures.Overall, the hotel's location and transportation are its biggest advantages, but there is room for improvement in terms of facility maintenance, sound insulation, and guest experience.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

I like the room designs and theme, it’s a bit old school and has character and charm. But it’s worn out and not well kept. The carpets were worn out, the wardrobe doors were too difficult to push/pull, the leather on the chair torn, the stool missing a tufted button, the table lamp cracked and wobbly, the sink clogged and slow to drain. I have had better experience at their other branch. This one is in dire need for an update, or some TLC.

Worthy to note, from 1/7/2024 they charge an RM4 fee per day for parking.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

"Ash Booth (& Penny Clements)","2024-12-08T08:27:42.603Z","3","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","I recently stayed at Royale Chulan and found it to be a bit of a mixed experience. The hotel's location is good, within walking distance to many central attractions, which is a real plus. Our room was a good size and comfortable, although it did take longer than expected for housekeeping to service it each day... 5/6pm! The front-of-house staff were friendly, though we did experience some issues with our room key, which after two attempts to get right we gave up.

However, there were several areas that let the hotel down. Alcohol is no longer available at the hotel, which came as a surprise. The pool area, while nice and quiet in the day, lacked any kind of drink service and had very few loungers with cushions, making it less inviting for a relaxing day. Another issue was that the photos on the website no longer reflect the reality - views of the Petronas Towers from the pool are now blocked by construction, and new photos should be taken to update this as you can’t see them even just a little bit.

The breakfast buffet was a chaotic experience. It was overcrowded, with guests being rude and staff struggling to keep up - we had to grab a table immediately after someone left and the staff wouldn’t change our cutlery / napkins.  We also found the complimentary water in the room to be limited to just four small bottles per day, which felt a bit stingy considering you can’t drink the tap water. Overall, the hotel feels dated and tired, and while it may have been a 4- or 5-star property in the past, it now seems more like a 3-star experience. It has potential but is in need of renovation, love and better service to live up to expectations.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"Tucker","2024-07-09T10:44:03.380Z","4","Selangor","I recently stayed at a charming hotel from the 90s, and the experience was quite nostalgic. The hotel features many classic designs that bring back memories of a bygone era. The room was spacious, the bed was huge and incredibly comfortable, which made for a great night's sleep. I was also impressed with the strong water pressure in the shower room, making showers refreshing.

One of the standout features of this hotel is the pool, which offers a stunning view of the Damansara skyline. It's a perfect spot to relax and unwind, adding significant value to the property.

Overall, my stay was satisfying. However, there are a couple of areas where the hotel could improve. The reception staff could be more welcoming; a simple smile during check-in and check-out would greatly enhance the guest experience. Additionally, I noted an ant infestation in the room, which is a matter that needs urgent attention from the hotel management.

For those planning to drive, please be aware that parking costs RM4 per day for in-house guests.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

The other room was in worse condition, with the paint coming off the walls and the doors made a screeching sound. The facilities given were also underwhelming, especially the Kiddie Land.

The breakfast was excellent, though, and there's a link bridge straight to The Curve, IKEA and the MRT close by. The hotel is fine overall, but it needs some renovations, especially the halls.","Royale Chulan Damansara"

For the first time in my entire hotel experience, this the1st 5 star hotel which their room service staff had forgotten to restock the most important toiletry needs: no bath towels or hand towels found. Perhaps they should hire a better housekeeping staff. To top if off, I had to call housekeeping twice to get them. Of course I only got the bath towels.

The hotel room was big, although it was aged. It had a sofa and separate room for Wardrobe and luggage. But the Aircon was weak, which made my stay uncomfortable. The temperature seems to be controlled by the hotel as it would always feel like 24-25 degrees no matter how low I set it. The corridors are also very hot and stuffy. Only the lobby has proper Aircon. The shower drainage was also poor and the toilet bidet is leaking. The safe box is spoiled and the Wardrobe doors don’t slide well. The bed linens had small stains and small hairs. The housekeeping staff need better training as they didn’t clean the room properly or replenish the amenities completely. One staff also chose to hold the lift, while I was inside, to mop the floor. I understand he was just doing his job, but he shouldn’t do it at the inconvenience of hotel guests. Front desk staff and cafe staff are very good though.   The breakfast buffet was average, but no Penang dishes at all. Swimming pool is small but cozy and water is nice.","Royale Chulan Penang"

"Reuben Tan","2024-12-25T02:38:09.386Z","2","Penang","My beef is with the staff at the cafe. My family and I were not shown to our table for our breakfast, only told to go to a table on the right by the staff at the entrance. I am not sure if there was a staff to lead us to the table, and if there was one, she was walking like 10 steps ahead of us without turning to see if we were following her. I was therefore not sure where our table was but I saw an empty one being cleaned by a staff but when we reached the table, that staff who was cleaning the table then told us the table was already reserved or taken by someone else. However, I didn’t see anyone else waiting to sit there. So I asked her where our table would be since we were told to go in. She then said    In a not so polite way that they would look for another table for us. The staff who seemed to be the one supposed to lead us was also clueless if we were the ones.  After some time, maybe after checking with staff at the entrance, she nodded her head from afar, and I was not sure what that meant and the staff who was cleaning the table just left us like that, so I presume that table was indeed ours. Such a strange and unpleasant experience that left me wondering if we were really in the wrong. As far as I am concerned, I did not enter the cafe without being let in by the staff, and I wasn’t till now told if that table was really meant for us, only told that it was meant for some other guests who were nowhere to be seen","Royale Chulan Penang"

The hotel shows its age, but the location is fantastic. Parking was a breeze; we were able to park in the designated bay for all three nights of our stay. However, the bathroom had an unpleasant urine smell coming from the wooden door, which I assume is difficult for the cleaners to eliminate. On a brighter note, I want to give a special shoutout to Mithu, the housekeeping attendant, for his warm hospitality and morning greetings. He even folded a towel into a dog shape on our bed and gifted us chocolates—a lovely touch that made our stay memorable.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Die Trennwand zur Dusche war leider undicht. Aber die Toilette war getrennt vom Badezimmer. Wir hatten seitlichen Blick aufs Meer, was Recht schön war. Frühstück ist gewohnt für Malaysia sehr umfangreich. Nur sollte man nicht zu den Stoßzeiten zum Frühstück kommen, dann muß man lange warten bis ein Platz frei wird. Für ein solches Hotel ein ""No-Go"".
Auch sollten wir beim auschecken noch warten bis sie unser Zimmer kontrolliert haben. Ebenfalls eine No-Go!!!!

second time- horrible non-window room with couldn't closed TV （maintainer cant fix too） so we sleep over whole night with TV on
third time- they let me check the room before i stay
and the aircon sound is quite noisy to disturb my sleep
but I couldn't ask for better room becos I give up

But the building is too old
Breakfast is good but the dining area has strong oil smell
And they don’t allow u to put outside food in their fridge after checkout

"nurnadhirah","2024-11-20T10:52:52.659Z","1","Penang","I recently stayed at this hotel for my cousin’s wedding, and it was a very disappointing experience.
1.	When I arrived, I was informed by the receptionist that I had booked two rooms instead of one, even though I was certain I only booked a single room for one night. The same issue happened to my cousin—she booked two rooms but was told she had reserved four. This is completely unacceptable.
2.	There was a minor makeup stain on a towel that could have easily been cleaned with soap, but instead, the cleaner took a photo of it and reported it to the receptionist, who then demanded an extra charge. My sister ended up washing the towel herself, and the stain came off effortlessly. Charging RM45 for something so trivial is ridiculous.
3.	To make matters worse, there was a cockroach in my cousin’s room. This is absolutely unhygienic and disgusting.

I usually enjoy staying at hotels, but this was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had. I will definitely not be returning.","Royale Chulan Penang"

The overall room decor looks like something from the seventies. We have stayed in better 3-star hotels, hence we are confused why this is a “5-star” hotel. Checked out after 1 night (we booked 3) of uneasy sleep (mattress was BAD!) and headed to Grand Hyatt instead. Best decision made!","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Apparently this is my 2nd time staying at this hotel.The lobby is not like any other modern hotels in KL, it’s a bit dated but in a nice way. The lobby is huge, very clean, smells good with a scent of frangipani. Room:Clean with dated furniture (not a problem), and a spacious bathroom. Shower, bathtub and toilet are separated and very clean. The water pressure is strong.Downside: the aircond was not cool enough, considering the current hot weather in Malaysia now.Breakfasts are delicious and a lot of varieties from Malaysian food to western. I truly enjoyed the breakfast and the attentiveness of staff to clear the used plates and the hospitality should be praised.Definitely going to stay at this hotel in the future.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"Trip.com Member","2024-09-30T23:59:59.999Z",,"Penang","The hotel seems to expect every guest to check each item in the room against an internal list when checking in. At check-out, they claimed there should have been two towels in the room, but only one was found. This puts unnecessary pressure on guests, as we’re not responsible for checking every item in the room upon arrival. This approach made the experience quite uncomfortable.This version expresses your concern about the hotel's unreasonable expectations regarding room inventory.We recently stayed at this hotel, and while the overall experience was decent, the attitude of the front desk staff, madam Liang, was truly disappointing. His responses to our inquiries were very impolite and lacked the professionalism one would expect. As the first point of contact for guests, the front desk’s service attitude is crucial, but this experience left us feeling very dissatisfied. We hope the hotel can enhance staff training and improve service quality.”This clearly expresses your disappointment with the service while conveying your expectations for improvement.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Checkin - seamless and quick. Also, it allows early check-in with just 150 MYR.

Rooms - showed signs of aging, and there were spots and marks all over the place. The room lights also didn't work well.
Poorly equipped.
There was a bad smell all over the property. Also, the AC vents had something dripping out. Not sure why none of the staff noticed.

Breakfast - not too bad. The spread was diverse and reasonable.

Location - in middle of KLCC and Bukit Bintang, so perfect. Just don't expect the place to be walkable from any of these locations.

What deserves a special mention?
The location is great as you are just few minutes' drive from KLCC and Bukit Bintang.

What could be better?
Rooms need to be overhauled and the whole property needs deep cleaning.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"P b","2024-10-25T03:58:37.484Z","3","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Initial look of the hotel foyer was beautiful. The breakfast Buffet had variety. Location was near the Pavillion mall.

Our stay was disappointing from the time we stepped out of the elevator to our room on the 2nd floor.  The decor was not maintained and dated. There were large patches of tiers in the carpet, patched unevenly could trip guests. Though the room was large, the carpet and furniture were stained and the towels were stained and torn. The room and washroom had a musty smell and felt unclean. The washroom glass metal dividers were rusted. We brought to the attention of the reception on the state of the room and the linens. Towel replacement was sent for the bath towels and none others. No other effort was made to make our stay pleasant.

The check-in to check-out was slow and unpleasant.  There are lots of customer service, but we didn’t  get a trained one andeven though we explained with the receipts we were over charged on our deposits for dining. Thankfully the person who dealt with us on the deposits stepped in and corrected, not yet confirmed by us.
At check-in (as always) our credit card was given for the deposit, but we were unable to charge any additional expenses to our room. We didn’t know we had to deposit additional money to be able to cover additional expenses to the room.  After we deposited the additional coverage on the second day, at the breakfast check out they stood us up and stopped the line-up, to call and check. We were embarrassed.
This review is mainly to get the hotel management to keep to the standard of a 5 star hotel as advertised on the website.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

When we called the staff to request, they brought 2 small hand towels. The next day, when we noted down the housekeeping staff to add more face towels, they put the face towels in. The special thing is, during the 3 nights of staying here, there was a smell in the bathroom and toilet like armpit odor that lasted for 3 nights without disappearing, making me very uncomfortable. I thought this was very strange, I had never encountered it in any hotel I had ever stayed in. As for breakfast, there were only Halal dishes and traditional Malaysian dishes, so I couldn't eat anything.","Royale Chulan Penang"

It was tasteless and unattractive to eat. Your hospitality also should and must be improved especially your staffs working at level 1 for breakfast time. They looks gloomy and i guess most of them looks like having big personal problem. No smile and greetings. This was really bad. Im just giving you honest review for you to improve. Hoping instant action will be made. Thanks.","Royale Chulan Penang"

The staff, from reception to housekeeping and even the guards, are exceptionally friendly and attentive. I have no complaints at all.

The breakfast spread is wonderful, with the Nasi Lemak being a highlight. The service is quick and the staff are well-trained.

Thank you, Royale Chulan, for always providing such great hospitality.","Royale Chulan Penang"

"Dr Suffian","2024-10-19T23:13:43.035Z","1","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Had an weekend getaway with family after hectic months. Decided to stay here for the first time with family for 2 nights. Upon check-in, i was upgraded to bigger room which i thankful for it. Room 301. I was told by the receptionist that its located at the other wing, so better walk across the hall and take the opposite lift since its closer and we did. Upon arriving at Level 3, we are dumbstruck since there is no room 301. Manage to walk throughout the floor and only to realize that 301 located RIGHT ON TOP of the reception wing. Ok that was not a good start. Probably the receptionist just newly started, wont let that ruined my precious weekend. Upon arrived at the room, deco was like 10 years ago, but i believe blended quite well with the overall hotel theme. Regardless, upgrade your TV for the suite rather than using the 32"" LCD screen which is not usable since everything hang. God. At night, we just realized that the toilet pump is leaking. Water keep on overflowing into the toilet bowl, creating a distrubing night. Since its already a midnight and kids already settling in, i decided to call up the hotel team tomorrow morning instead. Next morning, my wife called once - no action. I returned back to the room on the afternnon seeing the water still overflowing - called for the 2nd time and i want them to make sure its fixed before we came back from a dinner. Surely enough, no more water overflowing but now there is no water at all to flush the toilet. From bad, it turns into worst. Now we cant take a dump in our upgraded room. I had enough, wont call again and just go ahead and just gonna checkout instead. With the pricepoint, there is vast option outside to consider. Extremely bad experience and will never recommended to anyone to stay here.

Checked in - 18 Oct 2024
Checked out - 20 Oct 2024

"Nurul Fathirah","2024-10-15T07:07:19.228Z","3","Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","our 4 days 3 nights stay here weren’t that great. we booked studio, but been told that the room is the lowest specs due to the sizes and etc and they offered us upgraded to deluxe. as I need to cook for my son during the day we stick to our initial booking.

you know what the most unpleasant experience? the staff at the entrance after he loaded out our luggage, he just left our stuffs at the front door, and no one attended me that time. MY HAND IS FULL, I nee to carry my bags, my son running here and there, can you imagine? you have to carry the bag also at the same time to hold your son ALONE. I can sense they only help people with high standard looking with expensive cars. also one lady at the cafe during breakfast (really not friendly, making a weird face when i asked her for kids friendly cutlery.)

2. now the ROOM. ( dirty filthy carpets, no hand towels, one bath matt only, )what on earth you booked studio room with kitchen BUT THEY DIDNT PROVIDE YOU THE DISH SOAP? NO BOWL NO PLATES NO FORK SPOON ETC NO COOKING UTENSILS, until u asked them. okay they gave us bowl pot n pans. can you imagine we only have ONE FREAKING SMALL SPOON. for our 4 days stay? how to eat? and how to drink? and the worse part! YOU PAID FOR THE ROOM BUT THE MICROWAVE ISNOT WORKING.

3. oh ya dont forget about the two telephones provided in the rooms. BOTH CANNOT BE USED. but guess what? during our last day, wow, i was so suprised, we receive a call from front desk (it was 12.30pm) i guess that’s a call to remind us to get off from the room asap. oh wow? does the phone is working ? i cant even use your phone for 4 days for emergency / housekeeping, I EVEN HAD TO CALL THE HOTEL USING MY OWN PHONE, and also they didn’t take any actions even i said the phone cannot be use, but you have the audacity to call your guests to fasten up the checking out process?

4. most of your staffs are not friendly(dining hall) except the front desk for checking in/out. ive been to perdana hotel, split second they help you to bring the bag, they even open the car door for you, the smiles and everything. same goes to four seasons, their services top notch.

5. oh ya breakfast? naah. western food very bland minimal option, , sambal nasi lemak, still got the flakes, nasi lemak very nice, but the good thing was, their croissants, when they’re still hot, very delicious. otherwise, most of the staff at the cafe were not very friendly, not even a smile or a good gesture to welcome us. i dont know, because ive been to few hotels such as : pavilion hotel, majestic, sofitel damansara, Four Seasons hotel, perdana hotel, i have never experienced any unpleasant/unfriendly staff. so yeah. but front desk staff, very friendly and professional

ですが…五つ星と思うと…。
その理由は、シーツが穴あき、シミあり。タオルも使い古しすぎて白が変色している。縁はほどけているような代物。それに出血染みまであり！これには引きました。枕も洗っているの！？と疑うようなおじさん臭…。2泊目に換えてくれないタオルを枕に敷いて寝ました。臭いので。
セキュリティBOXも壊れて使えなかった。
洗面は詰まっていて水がスムーズに流れない…。洗面台に汚水が溜まってしまい…。
2泊しましたが、2泊目のタオルも換えてくれず…。一泊目のがそのまま置いてありました。
しかも隣部屋と今は閉鎖されている扉で繋がっていたような部屋の作りになっており、隣の会話が筒抜け。3m先にお隣さんがいるのを感じながらの睡眠。うるさくて眠れずイヤホンをして眠る…

We book a studio for 2 for one night stay. Upon checking in, we were told that we had to wait like 10minutes as the room was not ready yet. After 10-15minutes the receptionist informed us that we got our room upgraded to Executive Suit.

It was a really really good room. Massive ones with high ceiling, big bath tub separated from the shower and a lovely terrace.

The complementary breakfast was good too. (although I was actually in town for a big examination so I couldn’t really enjoy). But will definitely happy to be back!

Pros:
+Very convenient location, in Weld Quay, Georgetown. Surrounded by many amenities.
+Deco is dated but colonial architecture is beautiful.
+Got the corner Studio Room unit. Amazingly spacious. Very high ceiling. Studio units are all situated at the top floor called Attic.
+Very long corridor leading to the corner unit. Reminiscent of the scene from the movie The Shining.
+Comes with outdoor veranda, nice place to chill. Ocean view.
+Water pressure for the bathroom shower is good and strong. Heater temperature is consistently hot.
+Room came with complimentary coffee machine.
+Large smart Android TV (Sharp brand). Able to stream YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime TV.
+Very comfortable and huge king size bed. Didn't measure but feels like a Californian King.
+International electrical plug.
+Amazing breakfast, wide variety of dishes. Had 3 live cooking stations serving egg, noodle soup and roti chanai.

Con:
- Aircon unit was audibly noisy.
- WiFi speed of 5 Mbps. Very slow in 2024.
- TV streaming through phone is annoying as all the TV names are similar/same, i.e. model number of TV. TV should been renamed based on room number. Ended up playing streaming tennis match with adjoining room who was also streaming from the phone.","Royale Chulan Penang"

The location of the hotel was also a big plus with 5 steps to The Curve mall and 15 steps to the IPC/Ikea. My stay was incredibly convenient especially with the Train station located just nearby. It made getting around the city so easy and hassle-free.

Overall, I highly recommended this hotel for anyone looking for a great deal without compromising quality and service. I’ll definitely be back!!","Royale Chulan The Curve"

From the looks of it, it seems that the hotel is quite old, however they maintained the hotel room really well. The toilet facilities in the hotel room weee great .The hotel is 8 minutes walk to the Padang Kota Lama foodcourt, and approximately 15 minutes to Little India and Jalan Kapitan Keling mosque , which makes it quite easy for the in-house guests to walk around the George Town city.

The staff was amazing and quick with every need that we had.

Immediately upon opening arriving there is someone to open the door for you and the front desk is very attentive and friendly to work with. The check in process was easy and quick.

The rooms themselves are beautiful. Spacious room, with a large king sized bed and large bathroom. Constantly kept clean. My only gripes were that the pressure from the rain shower was weak and that they had no spare adaptors for chargers.

For us, we had free breakfast which tasted delicious with a variety of local and western options. Definitely worth the quick bite before heading out to explore Penang.

From towels to blankets, the housekeeping staff was quick to get us everything. No complaints whatsoever.

"Amina Abdel Hamid","2024-07-14T09:49:08.704Z","1","Penang","I had mold in my rice. My rice! Absolutely unbelievable. Any hotel of any rating should be able to serve fresh rice as it is not a difficult nor expensive dish to make. But I was given moldy rice at this establishment and of course freaked out as rice mold can give you terrible gastrointestinal maladies and ruin your whole vacation.

I first gave the earthy taste of the rice the benefit of doubt since they garnished this dish with flowers (see pictures) and I may have nibbled on some. But after closer scrutinization and smelling it, I realized that the earthy smell and blue black/yellow clumping of rice is actually mold. The meat didn’t smell freshly cooked either. The problem was I already ate half the dish before realizing it.

My husband promptly informed the staff of this issue explaining how this could potentially ruin our holidays inquiring how the hotel will make up for it, in case I do end up ill because of their food. How they handled our concern was unprofessional at best.

The cook was defensive, claiming the black dots were dill and not mold. The receptionist claimed it‘s not her responsibility but later retracted her claim taking accountability. When we suggested they take me to hospital if I get sick free of charge, they suggested I go immediately, because „a driver is available now but not later“.

For context, I travelled all day to get there and was exhausted. Ordered room service at around 9:30pm and ate that moldy dish, had to vomit afterwards. Around 11pm they wanted to take me to the hospital because it‘s convenient for them, but I needed my sleep. My husband had to convince them to help me organize transport IF I got sicker during the night, but they insisted I go immediately as „no driver will be available later“.

Long story short, they agreed to our proposal, but not without a discussion. The next day when we addressed the issue at the reception they didn‘t even want to reimburse us for the moldy meal telling us it‘s not their department. After my husband contacted the head manager we finally got an apology and a promise of reimbursement for the meal. We ended up not profiting of our paid breakfast to avoid eating anything spoiled. What a bad experience it all was!

As a guest I expect a hotel to cater to my needs and value my health especially if they potentially poisoned me with moldy food, without any discussion. Any respectable hotel will offer reimbursement for the spoiled meal and compensation without any hesitation!

The fact the food hygiene standard is so low, and the staff didn’t take accountability for the mistake immediately is what made me give a 1* review.

The hotel itself has a charming vintage vibe but without a good service, a hotel doesn‘t do its stars justice.","Royale Chulan Penang"
"Trip.com Member","2024-07-13T23:59:59.999Z",,"Penang","It was an awesome stay. The guy in the reception didn’t only stored our luggage’s when we arrived earlier than check in time but even allowed us to checked in right then and there. After a gruelling 10 hr bus trip (with delay) from Melaka, he sure was the light after hell 😂 Everyone was helpful, sometimes there might be a language barrier but they will still try to talk and not left you hanging! Rosalyn from the Restaurant was also helpful and informative giving us recommendation and tips!  Nothing but good things to say. Maybe just more attention to small details in the cleanliness of the rooms , like molds in the nooks and crannies of the bathroom area, bed fabric sliding off  etc. but nothing extreme to affect your stay.The hotel is convenient to walk around to. Just a stone throw there’s a local eatery  if you want to try  local food right away.","Royale Chulan Penang"

Don’t know which genius think the wardrobe and bed side table arrangement was good which makes it hard to access.

I’ve stayed at other Royale Chulan before but this takes the cake as the lousiest one. Even a motel room on top a shops-houses had better cleanliness than this. At least for the motel I know I’m paying a quater of the price and didn’t expect anything more.

It was within walking distance of many popular attractions, restaurants, and shopping areas. This convenience allowed me to explore the city easily without relying on public transportation.The staffs  were incredibly friendly and helpful. They were always willing to assist with my requests, from providing recommendations for local eateries to helping me arrange transportation. Their warm hospitality made me feel welcome and valued throughout my stay.While the hotel's decor and amenities may be a bit dated, they were still comfortable and functional. The rooms were clean and well-maintained, and the bed was cozy.Overall, I would recommend Hotel Royale Chulan to travelers seeking a classic hotel experience in a prime location.

"Rubbery Sha","2024-09-30T06:05:39.408Z","1","Selangor","Was skeptical before the stay based on the bad reviews.

Turns out that this hotel is really one of the lousiest I’ve stayed in Malaysia, considering the price point it’s charging.

When checking in, they offered me an upgrade, without me asking, and was told to return about 2 hours later. When I returned, they told me the upgrade was cancelled.

Room condition was really old and had so many issues. Even the toilet hook for hanging clothes was broken.

Requested for slight late checkout at 130pm and they granted it. When it was 1pm, the staff forced open my room and created a commotion as I had the door latch on. The receptionist calmly said that the housekeeping team are not aware, like it’s already a known problem.

Hotel staff could be friendlier. The porch security guards were the friendliest and most welcoming.

Overall below average. I won’t be making a return.","Royale Chulan The Curve"

The location is good. Downtown area.
The first room toilet leakage, the engineer was super nice and helped me to fix it, but after 5 min he left, toilet leakage is back.
I requested to change the room at 8:50pm, the reception asked me to wait for a while. Someone will come to my room to help me. Until 945pm, no one came here, no one contacted me at all. I went to the reception, reception checked with another person, and that person told me the hotel is fully occupied, someone was checking the room. Hardly believe the checking can last for 1 hours without anyone giving me a heads up. It is 945pm and I still need to work very early next morning.
I changed the room, the second room aircon is not working well. Only can adjust the wind, but temperature is not adjustable.
I understand the facility is old, sometimes need maintain and fix it. But I can’t believe that is the service for 5 star hotel.
Won’t choose this hotel anymore, and not recommend to stay.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Could be a Malaysia wide thing where the toilets are just not as strong as the UK ones. The toilet didn't flush properly though- hotel staff checked it but couldn't fix it.

The mirror in the hotel room is far from the socket and so I couldn't dry my hair with the hairdryer properly.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"Trip.com Member","2024-08-14T23:59:59.999Z",,"Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","We were very disappointed. We booked a non cancellable room two months before. A few days before we arrived we advised that we may arrive late. The hotel informed that rooms will be allocated based on availability. I said that I wanted the Premier King room that I had booked and nothing less. They again replied that allocation depends on availability when we arrive. Anyway, turns out we got the room type we wanted albeit with zero view. We looked onto a broken tiled roof. Room size was okay but not the advertised 40sq metres. No bath mat, no hand towels, no bath robes, dirty carpet, dirty pillow case that smelled like it was not replaced, poorly maintained furniture. I tried calling reception but the room phone was not working. I requested the missing items that were then provided. Regarding the phone not working, reception merely said oh yeah the phones on that side of your floor were not working. The next day the bath mat was again not replaced. I requested one and they sent a torn mat. I also informed the cleaner about a nail sticking out of the carpet and that I had stepped on it. He told me to inform maintenance. Seriously! I have to try to contact maintenance? On our third day we arrived back to the hotel at 10pm to find that the room had not been cleaned. We went to reception who said they will get housekeeping. After waiting a short while I said I would rather check out and go to another hotel than to wait for housekeeping. Then they called the manager who said that since I had booked non cancellable it may be difficult to get a refund and even if he could manage to get a refund for us it may take a month or more. ! He said he could give me another room. I didn't see why I should now have to pack my stuff at almost 11pm and move to another room. He said we'll he is offering me a suite and will have the porters help us move. At this point I just wanted to leave and even forget about any refund for what would be our last night at the Royale Chulan. However, leaving would still me packing up and then having to find another hotel at close to midnight. This situation was really stressful. Finally we decided to just accept another room at the same hotel. I must admit, the suite room was really nice albeit that the bedsheet was dirty and had to be replaced. Man! We will never go back there and will advise others against staying at the Royale Chulan. They hold themselves out to be 5 stars but are not even 3 stars in my opinion. By the way, we spoke to some staff who told us that there were many complaints about housekeeping.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Asked for help twice over the phone, and both times made me wait in the room for 20 minutes (we then left rooms for meals) and no one ever came. Expressed my complaint for the above while I went to the reception to use the safety box at the front desk, and a manager looking guy told me loud and clear that NONE of the safety boxes in the rooms worked and ALL are BROKEN. I said, in that case, why didn’t you tell me at the first place instead of making me wait for help that never came!?  And that gentleman questioned me if I understood English!?

Uncooked pasta till it was still crunchy , bread so old that taste like cardboard... such a bad experience... never again...","Royale Chulan The Curve"
"Tasha Ong","2024-07-02T04:04:40.605Z","2","Selangor","The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The room was acceptable for a night’s stay; old, some things like lamp, and the lighting in the wardrobe fell apart. Wasn’t very clean either.

The buffet breakfast is terrible. I bite into a broccoli that was filled with sand! Not only that, lots of empty tray (I went at 9am ish). Also, the roti canai tastes sour, chewy, and took the cook forever to make! The muffins they offered are like in neon green, and pink colour. The greens in the noodle stall is not fresh. So awful. Also, the wait staff are not attentive at all.

Please, change your head chef. Bad taste, lack of management and care.","Royale Chulan The Curve"

Wonderful breakfast though missing the days when Korea and Japan foods were at the buffet .  And BYOB executive lounge happy hour was one best..the only other best for Happy Hour since the pandemic is Renaissance Riverside in HCMC.  Only things missing were TVs the appropriate size for their large spacious rooms. And Taxis..no waiting taxis. Grab only","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

We especially like the location which is a short walk to Pavilion plus breakfast spread is quite extensive and delicious. The room is clean and well maintained even though furnishings are quite dated. We also experienced very low water pressure with hardly any hot water in the evening. I hope this can be resolved as we would lile to consider staying here again in the future.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

Breakfast is good but nothing to hype. Swimming pool is full with kids so adults better go to gym. The only thing that I really recommend is you don't have to drive here, drop to MRT Conlay and 5 minutes walk you're in their lobby.","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"

"Trip.com Member","2024-08-04T23:59:59.999Z",,"Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur","Staycation one night with my small family (1 toddler & 1 baby).Check in was very late process about 20 minutes by the receptionist. Entered the room (no.337) and feel eerie / goosebumps with the room itself as i found big whole garlic behind TV cabinet. The bedsheet was slightly dirty with blood stained. Around 12.15 a.m., there’s sound made at TV area and kids became so tantrum. Breakfast was good and pool also was nice with not so cold water for kids but slightly dirty. Regretful to stay here as I thought it will be enjoyable trip due to celebrating my confinement ended and to make my toodler happy with this short trip. This hotel requires a major revamp of renovation and maintenance for hotel sustainability in the future as it has wise location for tourist spot!","Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur"
